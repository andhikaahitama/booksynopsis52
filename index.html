Bibliographical and historical comments and an extensive bibliography with 2000 works covering more than a century are provided.</p> <p>Volume 1 is devoted to the classical theory of measure and integral. Whereas the first volume presents the ideas that go back mainly to Lebesgue, the second volume is to a large extent the result of the later development up to the recent years. The central subjects of Volume 2 are: transformations of measures, conditional measures, and weak convergence of measures. These topics are closely interwoven and form the heart of modern measure theory.</p> <p>The target readership includes graduate students interested in deeper knowledge of measure theory, instructors of courses in measure and integration theory, and researchers in all fields of mathematics. The book may serve as a source for many advanced courses or as a reference.</p><p>Vladimir Bogachev was born in Moscow in 1961.

How did a lively, extrovert child turn into a reserved and defensive mature woman, highly self-critical and secretive? This new biography of Emily Bronte uses hitherto relatively neglected material to provide a portrait of Emily&#39;s life and art. Concentrating on her childhood, the author examines Emily&#39;s relationship with her family and her contacts with people outside the family, and develops his previous research into the influence of her father&#39;s Irish background. He has made a study of extant manuscripts and takes into account recent advances in scholarship and improved poem texts. The book looks as questions such as - what was the nature of Emily&#39;s feelings for Charlotte, Anne and Branwell, when was &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; conceived and was there a major revision, and was Emily writing a second novel when she died?</p><p>Edward Chitham is an authority on the history and heritage of the Midlands, and has published many books on the area.Virginia Woolf declared that biographers must blend the granite of hard fact with the rainbow of personality. If so, then this "life" is a pile of stone chips wrapped in fog. The fault is not entirely Chitham's; indisputable facts about Emily Bronte are scarce, and he is justifiably careful to avoid unbridled speculation. But his caution leads him to belabor his points mercilessly, to milk every possible drop of inference or conjecture from his sources. The result is a tedious book posing as the life of a flesh and blood woman but in reality a plodding account of one biographer's problems handling scanty evidence.

Later, while a student at Plymouth Art College, he began selling his cartoon drawings to newspapers. Since 1964 he has published a number of successful books for children, including the King Rollo stories, which he helped animate for British television. His first book for Lothrop was Snow Woman, of which Publishers Weekly said, "It is McKee's superb humor--conveyed almost solely in the illustrations...that wins the day." Of his second Lothrop book, <i>Who's a Clever Baby, Publishers Weekly</i> had this to say: "Grandma's alliterative frenzies are fascinating and readers will find Baby's manipulative stubbornness vastly amusing."</p><p>Mr. McKee enjoys traveling and doing books that "leave things unsaid." He</p>PreS?In this cleverly crafted pop-up book, the plucky patchwork elephant strolls through the jungle. With each turn of the page, he meets friends who insist that they have a specific talent that he lacks. They claim he can't stretch like Giraffe, hide things in his mouth like Crocodile, flap his wings and fly like Bird, or swing on trees like the monkeys. By good-naturedly twisting the interpretation of each of these tasks, Elmer proves them wrong, singing, "I can too." When the other creatures remark that they can't change colors like Elmer, he sings back that they can too if they "really try." There is plenty for children to examine on each page. In addition to the clearly marked movable illustrations, there are humorous side commentaries from a rather serious owl. It is important to note that small hands may require assistance in manipulating some of the pop-ups as they are somewhat stiff. Though the text does not flow as smoothly as in other "Elmer" books, the message is clear: anything is possible when one thinks positively.

Nonetheless, professional lawyers suddenly reappeared in Western Europe seven hundred years later during the 1230s when church councils and public authorities began to impose a body of ethical obligations on those who practiced law. James Brundage&#x2019;s <i>The Medieval Origins of the Legal Profession</i> traces the history of legal practice from its genesis in ancient Rome to its rebirth in the early Middle Ages and eventual resurgence in the courts of the medieval church.<br> By the end of the eleventh century, Brundage argues, renewed interest in Roman law combined with the rise of canon law of the Western church to trigger a series of consolidations in the profession. New legal procedures emerged, and formal training for proctors and advocates became necessary in order to practice law in the reorganized church courts. Brundage demonstrates that many features that characterize legal advocacy today were already in place by 1250, as lawyers trained in Roman and canon law became professionals in every sense of the term. A sweeping examination of the centuries-long power struggle between local courts and the Christian church, secular rule and religious edict, <i>The Medieval Origins of the Legal Profession</i> will be a resource for the professional and the student alike.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>James A. Brundage </b>is the Ahmanson-Murphy Distinguished Professor Emeritus of History and Law at the University of Kansas. He is the author of nine books, including <i>Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&#x201c;Long-awaited, Professor Brundage&#x2019;s history of the medieval (and ancient Roman) origins of the legal profession was well worth waiting for. Brundage masterfully weaves together the history of the teaching of law as an academic subject, the explosion of new sources of law, the emergence of the university, the emergence of formal courts, and the development of Romano-canonical procedure. All these topics, many of which are quite controversial, are handled with a deftness and clarity that provokes admiration and, for those of us who have tried to write about the same things, a tinge of envy. This book will stand for many years as a monument, not only in the history of the legal profession but also in the history of European law.&#x201d;</p> (Charles Donahue, Jr., Paul A.

With wit and style, James Brundage is the first to have written a book that covers all this territory: the origins of lawyers in European society as well as their professional associations, status, education, and work. <i>The Medieval Origins of the Legal Profession</i> will be read and used by undergraduates, law students, and historians alike.&#x201d; (Kenneth Pennington, Catholic University of America School of Law 2007-11-02)<br><br><p>&#x201c;James Brundage&#x2019;s <i>The Medieval Origins of the Legal Profession</i> is a major work of original scholarship, the crowning achievement of a long and distinguished career as a historian of the medieval canon law. He has succeeded brilliantly in this first general account of the emergence of canon lawyers as a recognizable professional group. This book will, undoubtedly, be recognized as a work of fundamental importance to all scholars working on canon law or indeed more widely on medieval lawyers.&#x201d;</p> (Paul Brand, University of Oxford 2007-09-06)<br><br><p>&#x201c;The first several chapters provide sparkling synopses of legal procedures and the roles of legal experts during the Roman Empire, the early Middle Ages, and the beginnings of the revival of Roman law in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, which is ascribed to the powerful texts that drove it. . . .

In 1995, after resigning from her job as a professor at a university in Tehran due to repressive policies, Azar Nafisi invited seven of her best female students to attend a weekly study of great Western literature in her home. Since the books they read were officially banned by the government, the women were forced to meet in secret, often sharing photocopied pages of the illegal novels. For two years they met to talk, share, and "shed their mandatory veils and robes and burst into color." Though most of the women were shy and intimidated at first, they soon became emboldened by the forum and used the meetings as a springboard for debating the social, cultural, and political realities of living under strict Islamic rule. They discussed their harassment at the hands of "morality guards," the daily indignities of living under the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime, the effects of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, love, marriage, and life in general, giving readers a rare inside look at revolutionary Iran. The books were always the primary focus, however, and they became "essential to our lives: they were not a luxury but a necessity," she writes. <p></p><p> Threaded into the memoir are trenchant discussions of the work of Vladimir Nabokov, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jane Austen, and other authors who provided the women with examples of those who successfully asserted their autonomy despite great odds. The great works encouraged them to strike out against authoritarianism and repression in their own ways, both large and small: "There, in that living room, we rediscovered that we were also living, breathing human beings; and no matter how repressive the state became, no matter how intimidated and frightened we were, like Lolita we tried to escape and to create our own little pockets of freedom," she writes. In short, the art helped them to survive. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>&#x201c;Anyone who has ever belonged to a book group must read this book. Azar Nafisi takes us into the vivid lives of eight women who must meet in secret to explore the forbidden fiction of the West. It is at once a celebration of the power of the novel and a cry of outrage at the reality in which these women are trapped. The ayatollahs don&#x2019;t know it, but Nafisi is one of the heroes of the Islamic Republic.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Geraldine Brooks, author of <i>Nine Parts of Desire</i><br><br> &#x201c;I was enthralled and moved by Azar Nafisi&#x2019;s account of how she defied, and helped others to defy, radical Islam&#x2019;s war against women. Her memoir contains important and properly complex reflections about the ravages of theocracy, about thoughtfulness, and about the ordeals of freedom&#x2014;as well as a stirring account of the pleasures and deepening of consciousness that result from an encounter with great literature and with an inspired teacher.&#x201d;&#x2014;Susan Sontag<br><br>&#x201c;When I first saw Azar Nafisi teach, she was standing in a university classroom in Tehran, holding a bunch of red fake poppies in one hand and a bouquet of daffodils in the other, and asking, What is kitsch? Now, mesmerizingly, she reveals the shimmering worlds she created in those classrooms, inside a revolution that was an apogee of kitsch and cruelty. Here, people think for themselves because James and Fitzgerald and Nabokov sing out against authoritarianism and repression.

Thus, as we learn how a leaf (and the plant to which it is attached) uses various strategies to maintain appropriate water balance, we also learn why these strategies are important. Those larger points allow Vogel and his readers to reach beyond botany to the entire natural world. He mixes the principles of biology with those of physics to great effect, demonstrating the constraints the physical world places on living organisms and the limited options available to evolution. . . .

Seidensticker focuses on Tokyo in the years between the Meiji Restoration and the earthquake of 1923 to illustrate this change. He shows how Tokyo, which was called Edo until 1867, emerged from being the shogun&#39;s capital and the biggest city in a country which had been closed to the outside world for two and a half centuries, to a modern city, open to Western ideas.</p><p>Engagingly written.

The Holy Spirit is so actively involved in our lives that we can take his presence for granted. As they say, familiarity breeds contempt. Just as we take breathing for granted, we can take the Holy Spirit for granted simply because we constantly depend on him. Like the cane that soon feels like an extension of the blind man&#x2019;s own body, we too easily begin to think of the Holy Spirit as an extension of ourselves.</p><p>Yet the Spirit is at the center of the action in the divine drama from Genesis 1:2 all the way to Revelation 22:17. The Spirit&#x2019;s work is as essential as the Father&#x2019;s and the Son&#x2019;s, yet the Spirit&#x2019;s work is always directed to the person and work of Christ. In fact, the efficacy of the Holy Spirit&#x2019;s mission is measured by the extent to which we are focused on Christ. The Holy Spirit is the person of the Trinity who brings the work of the Father, in the Son, to completion. In everything that the Triune God performs, this perfecting work is characteristic of the Spirit.</p><p>In <em>Rediscovering the Holy Spirit</em>, author, pastor, and theologian Mike Horton introduces readers to the neglected person of the Holy Spirit, showing that the work of God&#x2019;s Spirit is far more ordinary and common than we realize. Horton argues that we need to take a step back every now and again to focus on the Spirit himself&#x2014;his person and work&#x2014;in order to recognize him as someone other than Jesus or ourselves, much less something in creation. Through this contemplation we can gain a fresh dependence on the Holy Spirit in every area of our lives.</p></p><p><p>Michael Horton (PhD) is Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics at Westminster Seminary in&nbsp;California. Author of many books, including&nbsp;<em>The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way,&nbsp;</em>he also hosts the <em>White Horse Inn</em> radio program. He lives with his wife, Lisa, and four children in Escondido, California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>You don&#x2019;t have to agree with everything that Michael Horton says in this important book, but the main lines of his thought are certainly right and utterly transforming. The Holy Spirit is not &#x201c;shy.&#x201d; Nor is he the member of the Godhead who fills in the bits and pieces of our experience that the Father and the Son neglected to take on. By displaying the sweeping work of the Spirit across redemptive history, Horton not only deepens our understanding of Scripture but our grasp of what it means to confess God as triune. And that calls us to deeper worship. -- D. A. Carson, Research Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>Horton has given us a magisterial account of the person and work of the Spirit that is also a journey through the entire sweep of Christian doctrine. Along the way, he offers rich scriptural insights, engagement with key figures down the millennia and across traditions, and speaks into pressing contemporary concerns, drawing out the implications of a robustly scriptural and Trinitarian pneumatology for faith and life, worship and mission. -- Suzanne McDonald, Professor of Systematic and Historical Theology, Western Theological Seminary, Holland, Michigan,<br><br>Rediscovering the Holy Spirit is a veritable voyage of theological discovery in the engaging company of expedition leader professor Michael Horton. Plotting a fascinating course through the ocean of biblical theology, he maps out the terrain of systematic theology and sets up landmarks for the faith of the church as she confesses &#x201c;I believe in the Holy Spirit.&#x201d; En route he points out some of the breathtaking vistas and glorious panoramas of the Spirit&#x2019;s divine person and his creating, saving, and consummating activity. The whole expedition is a further demonstration of Mike Horton&#x2019;s remarkable ability to tackle great themes with both freshness of insight and joy in exposition. Here is a work to which readers will return and find themselves, in concert with the church in every age, gladly bowing in worship to the Holy Spirit &#x201c;together with the Father and the Son.&#x201d; -- Sinclair B. Ferguson, Distinguished Visiting Professor of Systematic Theology at Westminster Theological Seminary<br><br>Here is a carefully wrought work that reorganizes much of the material we expect to find in a doctrine of the Holy Spirit, connecting things too often bifurcated while distinguishing things too often conflated. This pneumatology pushes and pulls on some of our habitual categories because it attends so carefully to the Holy Spirit as the one who not only reconciles and perfects (the sections on the Spirit in creation and eschatology stand out) but also sanctifies and separates (the Spirit&#x2019;s role in judgment and consecration is strikingly accented). It is wonderful that Horton says considerably more here about the Holy Spirit than we have heard from him in previous books, but it is equally wonderful that what he says is in keeping with the main lines of his theological project: anchored in the Trinity, spanning redemptive history, and directly connected to the ordinary ministry of the church. -- Fred Sanders, Professor, Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University</p><h2>Engineering Properties of Soils and their Measurement</h2><p>This fourth edition has been revised to reflect new industry standards and reference computer program usage.

Soon after my arrival I joined the Single Tax Club, and took part in the second Grover Cleveland campaign, then going on. This club met regularly every week for several years. In due time I realized that at every meeting the same faces appeared and reappeared, week after week, and that none of them cared to hear anything but a gospel which they all believed. It did not take long for Single Tax to become a religious doctrine necessary to salvation. But, the Single Tax Club furnished a forum for ambitious young lawyers to win a hearing in; and I generally participated in the debates, which led to my speaking at ward meetings and other public gatherings from time to time. . . .<br><br>One night I was asked to speak at a West Side meeting, called to discuss some civic problem. The leading speaker was William B. Mason, who was at that time a state senator, and afterwards became a United States senator. I had long wanted the newspapers to notice my existence, but the reporters refused to even look at me. I entered the theater through the back door and noted with joy that the place was packed. In front of the stage were a half-dozen or more newspaper reporters that gladdened my heart. Easily I sized up the situation and felt that my time had come. After a few preliminaries I was introduced amidst loud calls for Mason. I looked around and over at the audience, trying to gain their attention. The eyes can be very useful for quelling an audience or forcing people to focus on a speaker. I made my speech. I feel sure that it was not very bad. Probably not bad enough. I could see that the audience was waiting for William B. Mason, so I took no chances in delaying them too long. But the one thing that forcibly impressed me while I spoke was that not one of the newspaper men wrote a single line. They leaned back in their chairs and glanced at me with the complacent and sophisticated countenances of newspaper men. They knew why they were there, and whom their editors and the public would want to read about the next day. When I sat down there was slight applause. No speaker can get along without at least a little of that. Such approval as was manifested by the politest and kindliest there was drowned in the cries for &#x201c;Mason!&#x201d; They had come to hear him and were not interested in waiting. . . .<br><br>After the meeting at the West Side hall I was in gloom amounting almost to despair. If it had been possible I would have gone back to Ohio; but I didn&#x2019;t want to borrow the money, and I dreaded to confess defeat. I did not then know the ways of Fate. I did not know that Fortune comes like the day, sometimes filled with sunshine, sometimes hidden in gloom. I had not then learned that one must accept whatever comes along without regret; that he must not take either gratification or disappointment too seriously. I did not know, as Bret Harte put it, that the only sure thing about luck is that it will change. And luck can change as suddenly as daylight and darkness in a tropical land.<br><br>Soon after the blow in connection with the West Side meeting a &#x201c;Free Trade Convention&#x201d; was staged in Chicago. The closing session was held in Central Music Hall, at that time the most popular auditorium in the city; Henry George was to be the big drawing-card. Mr. George was then in the zenith of his power. I was invited to appear on the same programme. The great auditorium was packed, to my satisfaction. I looked out upon the audience with renewed hope. Every Single Taxer in Chicago seemed to be present, and a great throng besides. Mr. George was the first speaker, which looked ominous to me. I was afraid of either the first or last place; either one seemed fraught with peril. No one knew the tariff question better than Henry George. More than this, he was a strong idealist, and had the audience in his grasp from the first moment to the last. Every one but me was carried away with his able address. I was disappointed. I was sorry that it was so good. I twitched nervously in my chair until he had finished and the applause began to die away. I felt that after his wonderful address I would not be able to hold the audience. I realized that the crowd had come to hear him, and that but a few among them had ever heard of me.<br><br>When the applause subsided people began getting up and going away. The show was over. I said to the chairman, &#x201c;For goodness sake get busy before every one leaves the house!&#x201d; Quickly he introduced me, and my friends paused and did their best to give me a good reception. I had discovered enough about public speaking to sense that unless a speaker can interest his audience at once, his effort will be a failure. This was particularly true when following a speaker like Henry George, so I began with the most striking phrases that I could conjure from my harried, worried brain. The audience hesitated and began to sit down. They seemed willing to give me a chance. I had at least one advantage; nothing was expected of me; if I could get their attention it would be easier than if too much was expected. Not one in twenty of the audience knew much about me. As a matter of fact, I had taken great pains to prepare my speech. The subject was one that had deeply interested me for many years, one that I really understood. In a short time I had the attention of the entire audience, to my surprise. Then came the full self-confidence which only a speaker can understand; that confidence that is felt as one visits by the fireside, when he can say what he pleases and as he pleases; when the speaker can, in fact, visit with the audience as with an old-time friend. I have no desire to elaborate on my talk, but I know that I had the people with me, and that I could sway those listeners as I wished.<br><br>But the crowning triumph had come as I warmed to my subject and waxed earnest in what I had to say, and became aware that the newspaper men down in front were listening, and were plying their pencils, recording my words, or seeming to record them, as fast as they shot past. When I finally finished, the audience was indeed generous and encouraging with its applause and appreciation. Henry George warmly grasped my hand. My friends and others came around me, and it was some time before I could leave the stage.<br><br>I have talked from platforms countless times since then, but never again have I felt that exquisite thrill of triumph after a speech. This was forty years ago, and even now I occasionally meet some one who tells me that he heard my speech at Central Music Hall the night I was there with Henry George.<br><br>Main Selection<br><br>Clarence Darrow, &#x201c;Crime and Criminals&#x201d; An address delivered to prisoners in the Cook County Jail, Chicago, Illinois (1902)<br><br>If I looked at jails and crimes and prisoners in the way the ordinary person does, I should not speak on this subject to you. The reason I talk to you on the question of crime, its cause and cure, is because I really do not in the least believe in crime. There is no such thing as a crime as the word is generally understood. I do not believe there is any sort of distinction between the real moral condition of the people in and out of jail. One is just as good as the other. The people here can no more help being here than the people outside can avoid being outside. I do not believe that people are in jail because they deserve to be. They are in jail simply because they cannot avoid it on account of circumstances which are entirely beyond their control and for which they are in no way responsible.<br><br>I suppose a great many people on the outside would say I was doing you harm if they should hear what I say to you this afternoon, but you cannot be hurt a great deal anyway, so it will not matter. Good people outside would say that I was really teaching you things that were calculated to injure society, but it&#x2019;s worth while now and then to hear something different from what you ordinarily get from preachers and the like. These will tell you that you should be good and then you will get rich and be happy. Of course we know that people do not get rich by being good, and that is the reason why so many of you people try to get rich some other way, only you do not understand how to do it quite as well as the fellow outside.<br><br>There are people who think that everything in this world is an accident. But really there is no such thing as an accident. A great many folks admit that many of the people in jail ought not to be there, and many who are outside ought to be in. I think none of them ought to be here. There ought to be no jails, and if it were not for the fact that the people on the outside are so grasping and heartless in their dealings with the people on the inside, there would be no such institution as jails.<br><br>I do not want you to believe that I think all you people here are angels. I do not think that. You are people of all kinds, all of you doing the best you can, and that is evidently not very well&#x2014;you are people of all kinds and conditions and under all circumstances. In one sense everybody is equally good and equally bad. We all do the best we can under the circumstances. But as to the exact things for which you are sent here, some of you are guilty and did the particular act because you needed the money. Some of you did it because you are in the habit of doing it, and some of you because you are born to it, and it comes to be as natural as it does, for instance, for me to be good.<br><br>Most of you probably have nothing against me, and most of you would treat me the same as any other person would; probably better than some of the people on the outside would treat me, because you think I believe in you and they know I do not believe in them. While you would not have the least thing against me in the world you might pick my pockets. I do not think all of you would, but I think some of you would. You would not have anything against me, but that&#x2019;s your profession, a few of you. Some of the rest of you, if my doors were unlocked, might come in if you saw anything you wanted&#x2014;not out of malice to me, but because that is your trade. There is no doubt there are quite a number of people in this jail who would pick my pockets. And still I know this, that when I get outside pretty nearly everybody picks my pocket. There may be some of you who would hold up a man on the street, if you did not happen to have something else to do, and needed the money; but when I want to light my house or my office the gas company holds me up. They charge me one dollar for something that is worth twenty-five cents, and still all these people are good people; they are pillars of society and support the churches, and they are respectable.<br><br>When I ride on the street cars, I am held up&#x2014;I pay five cents for a ride that is worth two and a half cents, simply because a body of men have bribed the city council and the legislature, so that all the rest of us have to pay tribute to them.<br><br>If I do not wish to fall into the clutches of the gas trust and choose to burn oil instead of gas, then good Mr. Rockefeller holds me up, and he uses a certain portion of his money to build universities and support churches which are engaged in telling us how to be good.<br><br>Some of you are here for obtaining property under false pretenses&#x2014;yet I pick up a great Sunday paper and read the advertisements of a merchant prince&#x2014;&#x201c;Shirt waists for 39 cents, marked down from $3.00.&#x201d;<br><br>When I read the advertisements in the paper I see they are all lies. When I want to get out and find a place to stand anywhere on the face of the earth, I find that it has all been taken up long ago before I came here, and before you came here, and somebody says, &#x201c;Get off, swim into the lake, fly into the air; go anywhere, but get off.&#x201d; That is because these people have the police and they have the jails and judges and the lawyers and the soldiers and all the rest of them to take care of the earth and drive everybody off that comes in their way.<br><br>A great many people will tell you that all this is true, but that it does not excuse you. These facts do not excuse some fellow who reaches into my pocket and takes out a five dollar bill; the fact that the gas company bribes the members of the legislature from year to year, and fixes the law, so that all you people are compelled to be &#x201c;fleeced&#x201d; whenever you deal with them; the fact that the street car companies and the gas companies have control of the streets and the fact that the landlords own all the earth, they say, has nothing to do with you.</p><h2>Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure (Learning, Development, and Conceptual Change)</h2><p><p>When children learn a language, they soon are able to make surprisingly subtle distinctions: "donate them a book" sounds odd, for example, even though "give them a book" is perfectly natural. How can this happen, given that children do not confine themselves to the sentence types they hear, and are usually not corrected when they speak ungrammatically? Steven Pinker resolves this paradox in a detailed theory of how children acquire argument structure.</p><p>In tackling a learning paradox that has challenged scholars for more than a decade, Pinker synthesizes a vast literature in linguistics and psycholinguistics and outlines explicit theories of the mental representation, learning, and development of verb meaning and verb syntax. The new theory that he describes has some surprising implications for the relation between language and thought.Pinker's solution provides insight into such key questions as, When do children generalize and when do they stick with what they hear? What is the rationale behind linguistic constraints? How is the syntax of predicates and arguments related to their semantics? What is a possible word meaning? Do languages force their speakers to construe the world in certain ways? Why does children's language seem different from that of adults?</p><p> <i>Learnability and Cognition is included in the series Learning, Development, and Conceptual Change, edited by Lila Gleitman, Susan Carey, Elissa Newport, and Elizabeth Spelke.</i> </p><p> <i>A Bradford Book</i></p></p><p>Steven Pinker is Harvard College Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University.

Frances Marion was Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter&#x2015;male or female&#x2015;or almost three decades, wrote almost 200 produced films and won Academy Awards for writing "The Big House" and "The Champ."</p><p>Screenwriter Frances Marion (1888-1973) is the central subject of this excellent book, but mega-star Mary Pickford, journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns, bit-player-turned-gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper, and other high-powered female friends get nearly equal time. The author&#39;s skillful mix of biography with Hollywood history results in a densely textured portrait of an industry in formation and the intelligent, ambitious women who seized the opportunities it offered them for creative expression and financial independence.

Lew Wallace tells the story of a Jewish nobleman who fell from Roman favor and was sentenced to life as a slave-all at the hands of his childhood friend. Years later <i>Ben-Hur</i> regains his freedom in the famous chariot race. Through everything, <i>Ben-Hur</i> has an encounter with the grace of God.</p><p>This classic novel, subtitled A Tale of the Crist, has fascinated readers for generations with its vivid depictions of Jesus&#39; life interwoven with the fictional story of Judah Ben-Hur, a young Jew who finds his life inexorably changed by the Messiah.One of the most popular American novels of all time, General Lew Wallace's <i>Ben-Hur</i> vividly reimagines the mighty Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity. The saga of Judah Ben-Hur's spiritual journey from slavery to vengeance to redemption is both a vivid historical adventure and a powerful story of one man's religious awakening. As Blake Allmendinger writes in his Introduction to this Modern Library Paperback Classic, "<i>Ben-Hur </i>has endured for more than one hundred years because it offers something for everyone. The story of the Jewish hero Ben-Hur, his conflict with the Roman warrior Messala, and his conversion to Christianity at the foot of the Cross, combines adventure, sentimentality, athletic spectacle, and religious devotion."</p><h2>Infants, Toddlers, and Caregivers: A Curriculum of Respectful, Responsive Care and Education</h2><p>Combining a child-centered philosophy with problem-solving strategies, and a thorough discussion of diversity, <i>Infants, Toddlers, and Caregivers </i>serves as an ideal introduction to curriculum and care for infants and toddlers. <br><br> The approach to caregiving that underlies the text is based on Magda Gerber&#x2019;s philosophy combined with a bold new approach to the extensive 62 years of research done by her late colleague, Emmi Pikler. Focusing on the concept of respect in child care, both pioneers based their curriculum around responding to each individual child's needs in a warm and sensitive manner. Stressing the need for physical and social growth through planned and unplanned learning exercises, Gerber and Pikler's approach to childcare aims to develop the mental, physical, and emotional progress of each child. In addition to the new approach to Pikler's research, the new edition features expanded discussions on race, natural environments and exercise for children. <br><br><i>Infants, Toddlers, and Caregivers </i>applies this approach in a practical and engaging way for students and faculty in introductory early childhood courses.</p><p>Janet Gonzalez-Mena started her early childhood career in a cooperative preschool as a parent volunteer back in 1966. She then became a Head Start volunteer and ended up as a teacher in a preschool for Spanish-speaking children and their families in 1970&#x2019;s. She has also helped open several pilot programs including a therapeutic child care program and a home-based bilingual preschool program. When Magda Gerber came into her life in the mid-1970&#x2019;s, Janet signed up for an internship with her at the Children&#x2019;s Health Council in Menlo Park, California. As a result of that experience, later, when she became a child care director, she was able to incorporate much of what she learned into her work and was influential in expanding that program to include an infant center. Training and teaching adults has always been sideline, even when she was working with children and families. She worked as a Head Start trainer and as adjunct faculty in 4 community colleges plus the University of California Santa Cruz credential extension program. She taught for 15 years as full time faculty at Napa Valley College in the Child and Family Studies Program. Since 1991, she has been part of the faculty for WestEd&#x2019;s Program for Infant-Toddler Caregivers (PITC) Training of Trainer Institutes. Janet has been writing along with teaching for all these years and is author of numerous articles and 13 books related to early childhood, including Foundations of Early Childhood Education; Infants, Toddlers, and Caregivers (with co-author Dianne Eyer); and Diversity in Early Care and Education: Honoring Differences (Formerly Multicultural Issues in Child Care). She wrote Dragon Mom about herself as parent to help early childhood professionals alleviate guilt when their parenting doesn't live up to their high standards. Her latest passion is understanding more about the Pikler Institute in Budapest, Hungary, where Magda Gerber came from. It took her 30 years to get there after she first heard of it, but her first trip to it in November of 2003 merely whetted her appetite. She has made two more since and is planning for another one. She is fascinated by the approach and is convinced that this residential nursery is a model for the world. She is continuing to learn more about how this approach can be used to improve infant-toddler care and education programs in the United States. She is also working with a group in Mexico to explore how the approach might fit into their models of residential care for infants and toddlers. Janet has a Master of Arts Degree in Human Development from Pacific Oaks in Pasadena, California.</p><h2>The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity: Forces that Bring Riches to You</h2><p>You&#39;ve heard much in recent years about positive thinking.

Eugene Smith. Karales's earliest photo-essays had already come to the attention of Edward Steichen, curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which acquired two of Karales's photographs from his series on the Greek American community of Canton, Ohio. Another early photo-essay, on the integrated mining community of Rendville, Ohio, was featured in Karales's first solo exhibition, held in 1958 at Helen Gee's Limelight gallery in Greenwich Village. From 1960 to 1971, Karales worked as a staff photographer for Look magazine, traveling the world during a time of dynamic social change and recording the harsh realities he witnessed at home and abroad.<br><br> By the time Karales documented the fifty-four-mile voting-rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965 he had already developed a strong relationship with its most prominent leader, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and had been granted unprecedented access to the King family. That connection translated into a powerful empathy in the photographs that still resonates for viewers today. <br><br>The Village Voice described Karales's civil rights work as bearing "the weight of history and the grace of art." Controversy and Hope presents many of Karales's images from the era, including some photographs published here for the first time. Julian Cox, with the assistance of Rebekah Jacob and Monica Karales, has selected a bold representation of Karales's photographs, augmenting his visual legacy with biographical information and personal recollections. Civil rights leader Andrew Young, who appears in some of Karales's photographs, has provided a foreword to the volume.</p><p>The dynamic photography and story of an unsung Civil Rights documentarianJulian Cox is the founding curator of photography and chief curator for the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.

Based on Melville&#x2019;s own experiences, it explores the fascinating and often harrowing world of a naval fighting ship, the <i>Neversink</i>. The ship becomes for Melville a microcosm of America itself; its hierarchy, social divisions, and cruel practices suggest larger injustices, including slavery. <br><br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic reproduces the definitive Northwestern-Newberry Edition.</p><p>&#x201c;We find in [Melville&#x2019;s works] revolt and acceptance, unconquerable and endless love, the passion for beauty, language of the highest order&#x2014;in short, genius.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Albert Camus</b><b>Elizabeth Hardwick</b> is the author of many books and essays, including <i>Herman Melville</i> and <i>American Fictions</i> (available from Modern Library Paperbacks).

Grouped by artist, each print is accompanied by detailed commentary. Amongst the most celebrated of the artists featured here are: Utamaro, with his courtesans and geishas; Sharaku, with his portraits of actors on the Kabuki stage; and Hokusai, with his landscapes - among them &#34;36 views of Mount Fuji&#34;. The books&#39;s essays - by Mitsunobu Sato, Curator of Riccar Art Museum, Tokyo and Thomas Zacharias, Professor at the Munich Academy of Art - aim to familiarize the reader with the history of this art form, and examine the technique, content and style of Japanese prints and their influence on European art at the turn of the century.</p><p></p><h2>Writing to Communicate 3: Essays and the Short Research Paper</h2><p><p>With a combined process and product approach, <b> <i>Writing to Communicate</i> </b> puts students on a fast track to clear and effective academic writing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b> <i>Writing to Communicate&nbsp;3</i> </b> guides students from writing essays based on personal experience and opinions to adding information from outside sources to support their ideas in a research paper.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Features</b> </p> <ul> <li> <b>Theme-based chapters</b> encourage students to explore ideas. </li><li> <b>Adapted authentic readings</b> provide students with engaging content. </li><li> <b>Abundant and clear models</b> guide students to write effectively. </li><li> <b>Sentence structure</b> and <b>language focus</b> sections improve accuracy. </li><li> <b>Sufficient practice </b>with paraphrasing and quoting outside material helps students to support their ideas with research. </li><li> <b>Pair and group assignments </b>promote collaborative learning. </li><li> <b>Graphic organizers, checklists, and peer-help worksheets </b>enrich the writing process. </li><li> <b> <i>Bringing It All Together</i> </b> review sections provide opportunities for consolidation and assessment</li> </ul></p><p></p><h2>Sketches by John Constable in the Victoria and Albert Museum</h2><p>Amid all the drama of Constable imitations and fakes, there is one collection that remains essentially unchallenged - the collection of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. It was given to the Museum in 1888 by Isabel Constable, the artist's last surviving daughter, with the specific intent of keeping together a nucleus of unassailable work which had been left in the artist's studio at the time of his death. Isabel Constable's magnificent gift of some 400 sketches at once made the V&amp;A the principal single repository of Constable's work. The sketch is central to Constable's art and the essence of that art- the depiction of his native landscape in a naturalistic manner- can be much more readily grasped in his sketches than in his finished paintings. Indeed, during the first half of his career, he painted hardly any finished pictures, and even after he concentrated more on these from about 1819, he continued to be most inventive in his sketches. His oil sketches in particular, with their unequalled directness, are among the greatest triumphs of British painting. This monograph reproduces 66 works by Constable and traces the origin and development of his art.</p><p></p><h2>Handbook of Writing Research, First Edition</h2><p><p>This authoritative volume synthesizes current knowledge on writing development in children and adolescents and the processes underlying successful learning and teaching.

In this authoritative study, Thomas E. Skidmore, one of America's leading experts on Latin America and, in particular, on Brazil, offers the first analysis of more than two decades of military rule, from the overthrow of Jo�o Goulart in 1964, to the return of democratic civilian government in 1985 with the presidency of Jos� Sarney. <br> A sequel to Skidmore's highly acclaimed <em>Politics in Brazil, 1930-1964</em>, this volume explores the military rule in depth. Why did the military depose Goulart? What kind of "economic miracle" did their technocrats fashion? Why did General Costa e Silva's attempts to "humanize the Revolution" fail, only to be followed by the most repressive regime of the period? What led Generals Geisel and Golbery to launch the liberalization that led to <em>abertura</em>? What role did the Brazilian Catholic Church, the most innovative in the Americas, play? How did the military government respond in the early 1980s to galloping inflation and an unpayable foreign debt? <br> Skidmore concludes by examining the early Sarney presidency and the clues it may offer for the future. Will democratic governments be able to meet the demands of urban workers and landless peasants while maintaining economic growth and international competitiveness? Can Brazil at the same time control inflation and service the largest debt in the developing world? Will its political institutions be able to represent effectively an electorate now three times larger than in 1964? What role will the military play in the future? <br> In recent years, many Third World nations--Argentina, the Philippines, and Uruguay, among others--have moved from repressive military regimes to democratic civilian governments. Skidmore's study provides insight into the nature of this transition in Brazil and what it may tell about the fate of democracy in the Third World.</p><p>This sequel to Skidmore&#39;s highly acclaimed Politics in Brazil, 1930-1964 offers the first analysis of more than two decades of military rule in the largest and most influential country in Latin America, from the overthrow of Joao Goulart in 1964, to the return of democratic civilian government in 1985 with the presidency of Jose Sarney.<br><em>About the Author</em>: <br> <strong>Thomas E.

Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J. Skal (author of <i>Hollywood Gothic</i>, <i>The Monster Show</i>, and <i>Screams of Reason</i>) are the editors of the volume. Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it. The selection of criticism includes essays on how <i>Dracula</i> deals with female sexuality, gender inversion, homoerotic elements, and Victorian fears of "reverse colonization" by politically turbulent Transylvania.While serving as actor Henry Irving&#39;s business manager at the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker (1847-1912) also pursued his literary interests. In this Gothic horror novel of 1897, which brought him international fame, he presents the chilling vampire Count Dracula, modelled in part on Irving&#39;s powerful personality.</p><h2>Insurgent Identities: Class, Community, and Protest in Paris from 1848 to the Commune</h2><p><p>In this important contribution both to the study of social protest and to French social history, Roger Gould breaks with previous accounts that portray the Paris Commune of 1871 as a continuation of the class struggles of the 1848 Revolution. Focusing on the collective identities framing conflict during these two upheavals and in the intervening period, Gould reveals that while class played a pivotal role in 1848, it was neighborhood solidarity that was the decisive organizing force in 1871.<br> <br> The difference was due to Baron Haussmann's massive urban renovation projects between 1852 and 1868, which dispersed workers from Paris's center to newly annexed districts on the outskirts of the city. In these areas, residence rather than occupation structured social relations. Drawing on evidence from trail documents, marriage records, reports of police spies, and the popular press, Gould demonstrates that this fundamental rearrangement in the patterns of social life made possible a neighborhood insurgent movement; whereas the insurgents of 1848 fought and died in defense of their status as workers, those in 1871 did so as members of a besieged urban community.<br> <br> A valuable resource for historians and scholars of social movements, this work shows that collective identities vary with political circumstances but are nevertheless constrained by social networks. Gould extends this argument to make sense of other protest movements and to offer predictions about the dimensions of future social conflict.<br> <br></p></p><p><b>Roger V.

UP.</p><p><b>Meyer Friedman, M.D.</b>, the discoverer of Type A behavior and its relation to heart disease, is director of the Meyer Friedman Institute, University of California San Francisco-Mount Zion Medical Center. In addition to his voluminous medical publications, he has written the bestsellers <i>Type A Behavior</i> <i>and Your Heart</i> and <i>Treating Type A Behavior and Your Heart</i>. <b>Gerald W. Friedland, M.D.</b>, is professor emeritus in the department of radiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the author of many books and articles dealing with radiology, anatomy, embryology, physiology, and the history of medicine.<br><br>An almost gossipy look of the men who made some of the most significant discoveries in Western medicine. Friedman and Friedland, two physicians whose combined careers encompass over a century of teaching and practicing medicine (Friedman discovered the effect of Type A behavior on the heart), selected their own top ten and then had them vetted by antiquarian book dealers and physician-collectors of rare medical publications. Chronologically, the anatomical observations of Vesalius come first: his Fabrica (published in 1543) was, according to Friedman and Friedland, ``so scientific that it initiated medical science itself.'' However, they rate Harveys discovery of the circulation of the blood in the human body as the single most important, because it introduced the principle of experimentation in medicine. Leeuwenhoek is included as the founder of bacteriology, Jenner for introducing vaccination, Crawford Long for the initial use of surgical anesthesia, and Roentgen for discovery of the X-ray beam. Nearly unknown today are Ross Harrison, who first grew living tissue in culture outside an organism, and Nikolai Anichkov, who discovered the primary role of cholesterol in atherosclerosis. Fleming is credited with the discovery of penicillin, but Florey's role in its development is not overlooked. Similarly, the DNA story gives primary credit to Wilkins, while clarifying the role of Watson and Crick in elucidating its structure. In recounting the story of these achievements, the authors devote considerable space to the character and private lives of the men who made them. One's arrogance, another's dullness, their mistaken notions (Harvey believed in witches; Fleming thought of penicillin as simply an external germicide), their good luck and bad marriages, their ambitionsall are revealed. The authors conclude that it is not genius so much as curiosity and the ability to conduct a methodological investigation that distinguish them. While Friedman and Friedland's list of the ten best is sure to be questioned, their revealing portraits of notable men of science are memorable. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Originally published to rave reviews in Germany, <i>A Concise History of the Third Reich</i> describes the establishment of the totalitarian dictatorship, the domestic and foreign politics of the regime, everyday life and terror in National Socialist Germany, the events leading to World War II and the war itself, various forms of resistance against Hitler, and the Holocaust. The book&#x2019;s extensive illustrations are thoroughly treated as documents that illuminate the visual power of Nazi ideology.</p><p><b>Wolfgang Benz</b> is Professor of History and Director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universit�t Berlin. Among his previous books is <i>The Holocaust </i>(1997).Does anyone really need yet another book on Nazi Germany? After the masterworks of Richard Evans's multivolume history and Ian Kershaw's two-volume biography of Hitler, a certain ennui sets in. Benz is a leading German historian, the director of Berlin's Center for Research on Antisemitism. In this book, he sets out to accomplish what he did previously in <i>The Holocaust</i>: provide a concise, authoritative account, this time for the entire history of the Third Reich. At this he succeeds. Everything is here: the rise of the Nazi movement, the establishment of the dictatorship, culture, war, Holocaust and, finally, the collapse. Yet the treatment is flat, almost textbooklike. So many of the major interpretive issues that have engaged historians worldwide and the broader public in Germany are absent. For instance, Benz writes of the Hitler youth organization, but overlooks the question of how to incorporate into our interpretation of the Third Reich the experience of girls in the organization who often felt a sense of emancipation from the strictures of home and church. What were the connections between other forms of persecution and the Holocaust? How modern was the Third Reich? A concise interpretive work would have made for a much more satisfying book.

This book is a clear, authoritative guide to this complex area. He provides a survey of approaches to varieties of language, and considers these in relation to communication and task-based language learning. Swales outlines an approach to the analysis of genre, and then proceeds to consider examples of different genres and how they can be made accessible through genre analysis. This is important reading for all those working in teaching English for academic purposes and also of interest to those working in post-secondary writing and composition due to relevant issues in writing across the curriculum.</p><p>The author looks at varieties of language and considers these in relation to communication and task-based language learning.fm.author_biographical_note1</p><h2>Exploring Drafting</h2><p>Exploring Drafting is designed for use in introductory drafting courses at any instructional level.

Yet until now, there has been no guide to the various techniques available for determining that information and how those techniques can be used.For the first time, &#34;The Historical Ecology Handbook&#34; makes essential connections between past and future ecosystems, bringing together leading experts to offer a much-needed introduction to the field of historical ecology and its practical application by on-the-ground restorationists.The book begins with an overview chapter that introduces important concepts from ecology and restoration, and discusses various factors that need to be taken into account when attempting to discover and use historical information. Following that is a chapter-by-chapter presentation of individual techniques focusing on both culturally derived evidence (documents, maps, photographs, land surveys, oral history) and biological records (woodlot surveys, tree rings, pollen, packrat middens, opal phytoliths, animal remains, records of changes in soil and hydrology). Each chapter is written by a leading expert and offers essential background, tools, and resources needed for using the technique in a restoration effort. The book ends with four in-depth case studies that demonstrate how various combinations of techniques have been used in restoration projects.Case studies are from Nantucket, the Indiana Dunes, the Greater Grand Canyon Region, and the San Francisco Area Historical Project. Among the contributors are M. Kat Anderson, Kenneth L. Cole, Owen K. Davis, PeterW. Dunwiddie, Robin Grossinger, Michael L. Morrison, Michael J. O&#39;Brien, Thomas W. Swetnam, Stanley W. Trimble, Gordon G. Whitney, and many others.&#34;The Historical Ecology Handbook&#34; is a unique and groundbreaking guide to determining historic reference conditions of a landscape. It offers an invaluable compendium of tools and techniques, and will be essential reading for anyone working in the field of ecological restoration.</p><p>Evelyn A.

This book features prominent names in erotic male imagery, such as Fred Holland Day, Cecil Beaton and David Armstrong, along with an overview of the 21st century erotic photographic scene, from Herb Ritts to Pierre et Gilles.</p><p>It is impossible to separate out the history of representations of the naked male from the history of <i>gay</i> male culture, sensibility, or erotica. From the statuary of classical Greece to Michelangelo's <i>David</i> to the photography of Robert Mapplethorpe, the nude male form has signified for gay men not only sexual desire but homosexuality itself. <p> David Leddick's <i>The Male Nude</i> is an almost 800-page survey of the nude male in photography of the past century that presents us with the changes in body type, beauty, and sexual affect that have occurred over the past 100 years, but with evolving notions of "art" and "culture" as well. From Victorian prints of strong men to the "health" photos of the 1940s and '50s to the works of contemporary artists such as Mapplethorpe, Bruce Weber, and Nan Goldin, David Leddick charts the evolutions that the male body--and gay culture--have taken for ten decades. <i>--Michael Bronski</i></p></p><h2>JIT Factory Revolution: A Pictorial Guide to Factory Design of the Future</h2><p>Here at last is the first-ever encyclopedic picture book of JIT.

This focus has resulted in a uniquely approachable, but technically accurate presentation of the material. While providing a slightly more technical presentation of the material than more basic texts, this text is both approachable and comprehensive. The text includes a gentle introduction to the basic mathematics of measurement, and expands traditional coverage to include a thorough discussion of performance and portfolio assessments, a complete presentation of assessment accommodations for students with disabilities, and a practical discussion of professional best practices in educational measurement. </p></p><p><b>MyLabSchool &#x2014; Where the classroom comes to life!</b> <p></p><ul> <li>Watch real classrooms in action in the MLS VideoLab. </li><li>Study for the PRAXIS exam using our video cases and practice test! </li><li>Prepare for your first (or next!) job interview with the MLS Career Center. </li><li>Learn how to write effective research papers with Research Navigator.</li></ul> Contact your local Allyn &amp; Bacon sales representative for more information about this great tool or for the Valuepack ISBN.</p><h2>PRENTICE HALL HISTORY OF OUR WORLD NATIONAL TEST PREP BOOKLET 2005C</h2><p><p>From the Acropolis to Zimbabwe, it's an exciting year of world history for your middle-grades students!

What you'll find is a detailed listing for each of the more than 800 species of birds that one can expect to see visiting or living in North America. But what about birds more generally? What of the particular characteristics of grebes or finches or crows? How are we to understand the general ranges, overlaps, and connection between closely related species within such groups? Baughman, of the National Wildlife Federation, has brought together an impressive array of experts to create this useful and fun volume, which will be a welcome companion to the <i>Field Guide.</i> <p>The volume begins with an informative essay on bird physiology, evolution, behavior, and classification. Each of the ensuing chapters treats one of the 42 major groups of North American birds, comprising 78 individual families. Following a general essay about the group, chapters provide details on each family, including classification, physical structure, plumage, behavior, ranges, observation tips, and conservation status. Major species are represented with outstanding illustrations, and sidebars treat special topics. A basic glossary of bird terminology, a brief bibliography, and an index that will be familiar to users of the <i>Field Guide</i> round out the volume.</p><p>The volume is populated with hundreds of very useful maps. Each chapter contains maps that chart the ranges and migration patterns of major species or families. In the "specialty maps" section, there is a wonderful map of "important bird areas in the contiguous United States" (great for vacation planning), and nearly 600 of the small range maps from the <i>Field Guide</i> are reproduced. </p><p>This is an outstanding companion to the <i>Field Guide,</i> but it also stands on its own as an excellent introductory text to the world of birds. It will be at home in public and school libraries and also belongs in all serious recreational and academic collections that serve those interested in birds and birding.

He is appalled by his observations in all quarters of cheapness, shallowness, vice. He is appalled also by monotony. But monotony reigns only briefly. Soon Everett, the broken-down poet, and Winterbottom, the printer, have involved him in affairs which put a strain on his holiday spirit.

Tanizaki has got this warm, ticklishness to his strangeness.&#39; (David Mitchell)&#39;One of the finest pieces of literature concerning cats ever written.&#39;(Choice)Shinako has been ousted from her marriage by her husband Shozo and his younger lover Fukuko. She&#39;s lost everything: her home, status, and respectability. Yet the only thing she longs for is Lily, the elegant tortoiseshell cat she shared with her husband. As Shinako pleads for Lily&#39;s return, Shozo&#39;s reluctance to part with the cat reveals his true affections, and the lengths he&#39;ll go to hold onto the one he loves most. A small masterpiece, A Cat, a Man, and Two Women is a novel about loneliness, love, and companionship of the most unexpected kind. In this story of Japanese society and manners, Tanizaki gives us a perfectly-formed oddball comedy, and a love triangle in which the only real rival is feline.</p><p>Author of The Makioka Sisters, In Praise of Shadows, and A Cat, a Man, and Two Women, Junichiro Tanizaki (1886&#x2013;1965) is arguably the greatest Japanese writer of the twentieth century.[The following excerpt is from the novella "A Cat, a Man, and Two Women."] <p>Picking up a fish with his chopsticks, he held it high in the air. Lily had been standing on her hind legs with her forepaws resting on the edge of the oval dining table and staring, motionless, at the fish lying on the plate in front of her master. She looked like a customer propping himself up against a bar somewhere, or like one of the gargoyles gazing down from the spires of Notre Dame. When the piece was lifted from the plate, Lily's nostrils began to quiver and her large, intelligent eyes grew quite round, as if with human amazement, as she gazed up at the longed-for morsel. </p><p>But Shozo was not inclined to give in so easily. "Heeere it goes!" he teased, dangling the fish right in front of Lily's nose before suddenly snatching it away and popping it into his own mouth. Then he noisily slurped away at the dressing that covered the mackerel, crunched through the brittle bones, and began the whole process again with the next piece. Bringing it close, then withdrawing it to a distance, raising it, then lowering it, he tantalized the cat. Lifting her paws from the table and bringing them up high on either side of her chest in ghostly fashion, Lily began to pursue the fish, tottering after it on her hind legs. If the prey was brought to a standstill just over her head, the cat would fix it intently with her eyes and then make a leap for it, darting out with her front paws to seize it. She would just fail to get it, fall back, then leap again. It took her five or ten minutes of such frantic activity to secure one mackerel. </p><p>Shozo repeated the same thing over and over again. He would give her a fish, then himself a little drink, and calling "Lily" would raise the next prize high. There must originally have been some twelve or thirteen mackerel on Shozo's plate, each about two inches long, of which he himself had actually eaten perhaps three or four. For the rest, he had simply sucked out a bit of the vinegar dressing before giving the flesh to Lily. </p><p>"Ohh-ohh ... owww! That hurts!" Shozo let out a shriek. </p><p>Lily had leapt onto his shoulders and dug in her claws. </p><p>"Get down! Get down from there!" </p><p>It was past the middle of September, and the last traces of summer heat were fading away; but Shozo, who, like most fat people, disliked the heat and was prone to sweating, had brought a low table out to the edge of the back veranda, now muddy from a recent flood. He sat on top of it, wearing only linen half-drawers, a short-sleeved undershirt, and a woolen stomach-band. The shoulders Lily had jumped onto were fleshy and round like little hills; and to keep from sliding off she naturally had to use her claws. As they dug through the thin cotton undershirt and bit into Shozo's flesh, he gave another cry of pain. </p><p>"Get down from there, you--" he shouted, shrugging his shoulders violently and leaning to one side to encourage her to leap off. But the cat, determined to maintain her perch, just dug her claws in deeper until Shozo's undershirt began to be dappled with spots of blood. </p><p>Yet, though he grumbled about her "wildness," he could never bring himself to be really angry with her. Lily seemed to be fully aware of this as she gently rubbed her face against his cheek with little flattering noises and, if she saw that his mouth was full of fish, boldly brought her own right up to her master's. If Shozo interrupted his chewing to poke out a piece of fish with his tongue, Lily would nimbly dart her head forward to seize the morsel. Occasionally she would devour it all at once; at other times, she would lick the remnants from around Shozo's mouth, carefully and complacently. There were even times when cat and master would contend for the same piece, each tugging at one end. Then Shozo would put on an angry act, complete with grunts and cries, frowns, grimaces, and a little spitting. Actually, though, he seemed to be enjoying himself just as much as Lily was. </p><p>Resting a bit from these exhausting games, he casually held out his sake cup for a refill. "Hey, what's wrong?" Suddenly anxious, he looked up at his wife, who had been in a sunny mood until just a while ago but was now fixing him with a steady gaze, her hands thrust into her sleeves instead of offering the expected drink.</p></p><h2>Perception and lighting as formgivers for architecture</h2><p>This book provides basic theoretical information on environmental objectives and the process of visual perception and human needs as they relate to lighting design.

As these techniques become increasingly important, it is necessaryto realize that they are useful tools, but are not the goals of research. With this important distinction in mind, <b>Understanding Molecular Simulation</b> describes simulation techniques along with the physics behind the phenomena that these techniques simulate.<br> Each chapter is comprised of three components: the general theoretical basis, an outline of the necessary computer code, and a few applications which illustrate the use of the technique demonstrated. The chapters also include examples of the typical practical problems that could be solved using each technique. <br><br>Key Features<br>* Gives a unified presentation of computational tools used to study molecular systems in the equilibrium state<br>* Describes simulation techniques and physics behind the phenomena simulated<br>* Emphasizes important topics of phase behavior and computer simulation of macro-molecular (polymer-type) substances<br>* Includes references to the authors home page where additional information from the authors can be found</p><p>This book explains the physics behind the &#34;recipes&#34; of molecular simulation for materials science. Computer simulators are continously confronted with questions concerning the choice of a particular technique for a given application. Since a wide variety of computational tools exists, the choice of technique requires a good understanding of the basic principles. More importantly, such understanding may greatly improve the efficiency of a simulation program. The implementation of simulation methods is illustrated in pseudocodes and their practical use in the case studies used in the text. Examples are included that highlight current applications, and the codes of the case studies are available on the World Wide Web. No prior knowledge of computer simulation is assumed.Daan Frenkel is based at the FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics and at the Department of Chemistry, University of Amsterdam. His research has three central themes: prediction of phase behavior of complex liquids, modeling the (hydro) dynamics of colloids and microporous structures, and predicting the rate of activated processes. He was awarded the prestigious Spinoza Prize from the Dutch Research Council in 2000.<p>Berend Smit is Professor at the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Faculty of Science, University of Amsterdam.

Once the seat of ancient glory, it is now often the object of national contempt. It plays a significant part on the world stage, but the concerns of its residents are often deeply parochial. And while they live in the seat of a world religion, Romans can be vehemently anticlerical. These tensions between the past and the present, the global and the local, make Rome fertile ground to study urban social life, the construction of the past, the role of religion in daily life, and how a capital city relates to the rest of the nation.</p> <p>Michael Herzfeld focuses on Rome&#x2019;s historic Monti district and the wrenching dislocation caused by rapid economical, political, and social change. <i>Evicted from Eternity</i> tells the story of the gentrification of Monti&#x2014;once the architecturally stunning home of a community of artisans and shopkeepers now displaced by an invasion of rapacious real estate speculators, corrupt officials, dithering politicians, deceptive clerics, and shady thugs. As Herzfeld picks apart the messy story of Monti&#x2019;s transformation, he ranges widely over many aspects of life there and in the rest of the city, richly depicting the uniquely local landscape of globalization in Rome.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Michael Herzfeld </b>is the Ernest E. Monrad Professor of the Social Sciences in the Department of Anthropology at Harvard University and has taught at several other universities worldwide. He is the author of many books.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A wonderful book&#x2014;very exciting to read.&nbsp;Herzfeld has selected the extraordinary historic city of Rome to portray a riveting drama of eviction, class identity, neighborhood solidarity, and place attachment in the face of escalating gentrification.&nbsp;Housing shortages and the allure of neoliberal market logic have corrupted city officials and owners alike, resulting in a politics of fear of newcomers, the church, and the state. This ethnographer&#x2019;s acute grasp of language use and Roman forms of civility produces a rarely seen glimpse of how cultural heritage, real estate interests, and nationalism collide to destroy local residents&#x2019; lives and homes. Both scholars in the social sciences and practitioners in historic preservation and urban planning will enjoy this look into the consequences of neoliberal land use practices.&#x201d;</p> (Setha Low, CUNY Graduate Center)<br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Evicted from Eternity</i> demonstrates the distinctive promise of Europeanist anthropology and its relevance for the discipline more generally. Herzfeld&#x2019;s resolute commitment to a refined local ethnographic purview yields a text that is decisively about &#x2018;Europe.&#x2019;&nbsp;It is not merely a superb analysis of the famous Monti district of Rome or a contribution to the ethnographic literature on Italy, but the finest ethnography I know of to examine rigorously how the abstract processes of European integration are manifest in the daily lives of its citizens and, in this particular case, discernible in the transformation of virtually every aspect of their emblematic urban landscape.&nbsp;The text succeeds as a documentary account of contemporary human predicaments, as a moral inquiry into the nature of justice and injustice, and as a passionate narrative imbued with feeling and pathos. Herzfeld has drawn on his formidable scholarly acumen and his vast ethnographic experience to craft an analysis that is truly distinguished.&nbsp;<i>Evicted from Eternity&nbsp;</i>deserves to be acknowledged for what it is: a masterpiece.&#x201d;</p> (Douglas Holmes, Binghamton University)<br><br>&#x201c;In this work, Herzfeld&#x2019;s exceptional talents as a linguistically sensitive ethnographer and passion for social justice illuminate processes of gentrification in Monti, a neighborhood of Rome near the Colloseum known for artisan workshops, petty thievery, and a vibrant set of social relations wonderfully and cynically impervious to both papal and state authority. Constituting a form of neighborly civility, these relations are losing ground to an encroaching &#x2018;civic&#x2019; consciousness. By juxtaposing the civil and the civic&#x2014;and by exploring the Vatican&#x2019;s &#x2018;logic of indulgences&#x2019; as a template for, among other things, condoning violations of the building code&#x2014;Herzfeld transcends old arguments regarding corruption in Italy. A case study of eviction from one apartment complex brings home the tragedy of displacement while exposing a contemporary irony: right-wing political parties have garnered some support among &#x2018;red&#x2019; working class tenants, disillusioned by the Left&#x2019;s participation, along with the church, in the real estate development of Rome&#x2019;s historic center.&#x201d;--Jane Schneider, CUNY Graduate Center (Jane Schneider)<br><br>"An illuminating immersion in the numerous intricacies compounded in the changing urban dynamics of Monti, Rome's oldest district. . . .&nbsp;[A] &nbsp;striking, sophisticated and detailed ethnographic account of the daily aporias encountered in the heart of 'classic Rome.'

As patients and therapists find themselves reaching for new solutions to their problems, the traditional disctinctions between matters of the mind and matters of the spirit are increasingly being questioned. This book is written by a traditionally trained psychotherapist who has immersed himself in the Buddhist tradition. Drawing on his own experiences as patient, meditator and therapist, the author argues that the contemplative traditions of the East help patients go beyond merely recognizing their problems to healing them, and that such an approach is not at odds with the psychodynamic method. The book begins by focusing on the Buddhist perspective. Dispelling misconceptions common even among those already practising meditative techniques, this section presents the Buddha&#39;s psychological teachings in the language of Western psychodynamics. It then goes on to explain the meditative practices of bare attention, concentration, mindfulness, and analytical inquiry, and shows how they speak to issues at the forefront of psychological concern. Finally, the book uses Freud&#39;s treatise of psychotherapy - &#34;Remembering, repeating and working-through&#34; - as a template to show how the Buddha&#39;s teaching can complement, inform and energize the practice of psychotherapy.</p><p>Drawing upon his own experience as therapist, meditator and patient, Mark Epstein, a New York-based psychiatrist trained in classical Freudian methods, attempts to integrate Western psychotherapy and the teachings of Buddhism. Repressed memories, painful emotions, narcissism and destructive energies can all be uprooted through Buddha&#39;s teaching on suffering, delusion, wisdom and non-attachment. Epstein argues that in recognizing his or her self-created mental suffering, a patient can overcome neurotic behaviors and even overcome a deeply ingrained negative sense of self.<b>Mark Epstein, M.D.,</b> a graduate of Harvard College and the Harvard Medical School, has a private practice in New York City.</p><h2>Technology: Engineering &amp; Design</h2><p><em>Technology: Engineering &amp; Design</em> is helping today's students develop the technology of tomorrow!</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Raspberry Pi User Guide</h2><p><p><b>Make the most out of the world&#x2019;s first truly compact computer</b></p> <p>It's the size of a credit card, it can be charged like a smartphone, it runs on open-source Linux, and it holds the promise of bringing programming and playing to millions at low cost.

This is the first major biography of him for more than three decades, and the first for a century to exploit rich new manuscript sources in Britain and elsewhere.<br>Diarmaid MacCulloch, one of the foremost scholars of the English Reformation, traces Cranmer from his east-Midland roots through his twenty-year career as a conventionally conservative Cambridge don. He shows how Cranmer was recruited to the coterie around Henry VIII that was trying to annul the royal marriage to Catherine, and how new connections led him to embrace the evangelical faith of the European Reformation and, ultimately, to become archbishop of Canterbury. By then a major English statesman, living the life of a medieval prince-bishop, Cranmer guided the church through the king's vacillations and finalized two successive versions of the English prayer book.<br>MacCulloch skillfully reconstructs the crises Cranmer negotiated, from his compromising association with three of Henry's divorces, the plot by religious conservatives to oust him, and his role in the attempt to establish Lady Jane Grey as queen to the vengeance of the Catholic Mary Tudor. In jail after Mary's accession, Cranmer nearly repudiated his achievements, but he found the courage to turn the day of his death into a dramatic demonstration of his Protestant faith.<br>From this vivid account Cranmer emerges a more sharply focused figure than before, more conservative early in his career than admirers have allowed, more evangelical than Anglicanism would later find comfortable. A hesitant hero with a tangled life story, his imperishable legacy is his contribution in the prayer book to the shape and structure of English speech and through this to the molding of an international language and the theology it expressed.</p><p><b>Diarmaid MacCulloch</b> is a fellow of St. Cross College and professor of the history of the church, University of Oxford.

In CRAZY ENGLISH, Lederer frolics through the logic-boggling byways of our language, discovering the names for phobias you didn&#39;t know you could have, the longest words in our dictionaries, and the shortest sentence containing every letter in the alphabet. You&#39;ll take a bird&#39;s-eye view of our beastly language, feast on a banquet of mushrooming food metaphors, and meet the self-reflecting Doctor Rotcod, destined to speak only in palindromes.</p><p>One of the most unforgettable moments of my youth was learning the word <i>pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis</i>. I was in third grade. So what if Richard Lederer has come up with a chemical compound that consists of 1,913 letters? Owning a word like pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is empowering at any age. If you have ever been completely wowed by the power you can have over language, or its power over you, Richard Lederer is your patron saint. His oft-reprinted introduction to <i>Crazy English</i>, which was originally published in 1989, claims that English is "the most loopy and wiggy of all tongues."

Lederer's pace is frenetic.

"That's because language is invented ... by boys and girls and men and women, not computers. As such, language reflects the creative and fearful asymmetry of the human race, which, of course, isn't really a race at all." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Richard Lederer is the author of more than 30 books about language, history, and humor, including his best-selling <i>Anguished English</i> series and his current book, <i>Presidential Trivia</i>.

He reveals the findings of his own groundbreaking research of people who have fully recovered from schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, weaving the stories of these participants into the existing literature and crafting a surprisingly clear and coherent vision of the entire psychotic process, from onset to full recovery. </p><p></p><p> As this vision unfolds, we discover . . . </p><p> . . . ways to support those struggling with psychotic experiences while also coming to appreciate the important ways that these individuals can contribute to society. </p><p> . . . a deeper sense of appreciation for the profound wisdom and resilience that lie within all of our beings, even those we may think of as being deeply disturbed. </p><p> . . . that by gaining a deeper understanding of madness, we gain a deeper understanding of the core existential dilemmas with which we all must struggle, arriving at the unsettling realization of just how thin the boundary really is between madness and sanity.</p></p><p>Dr. Paris Williams offers the very rare and powerful perspective of someone who has experienced psychosis from both sides--as a practicing psychologist and researcher, and as someone who has himself struggled with psychotic experiences. In his late 20&#39;s, while in the midst of a very successful career as a hang gliding instructor and competition pilot (winning a World Champion title and multiple National Champion titles), Paris Williams suddenly found himself plunged into a profound struggle with experiences that would have likely resulted in the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Fortunately, he managed to avoid becoming entangled within the psychiatric system, and he instead embarked upon a journey of healing and self discovery, working to resolve his own personal crisis while aspiring to support others going through similar crises. He has since spent over a decade deeply exploring both Eastern and Western understandings of mind and consciousness, studying intensive meditation from a number of different masters around the world, earning a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology, working in numerous settings supporting people struggling with psychosis and other challenging and extreme experiences, and conducting a series of pioneering research studies at Saybrook University on recovery from schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. He continues to work as a psychologist in the San Francisco Bay Area."Every page of this book was exciting to me . . .

Other introductory material encompasses making use of UNIX tools. <b> </b>Further coverage includes a formal definition of the von Neumann machine, its relationship to programmable calculators, and to the JAVA bytecode and JAVA virtual machine. <b> </b>For engineers, computer scientists, and people in business who want to learn about SPARC Architecture. </p></p><p>An introduction to computer architecture for the SPARC� reduced instruction set architecture, this text teaches how to evaluate compilers, data strucures, and control structures in order to write efficient programs in a high-level language.Preface to the First Edition <p>This book is written as an introductory text in computer architecture for the SPARC reduced instruction set architecture. It is assumed that readers have a working knowledge of C and UNIX. The GNU compiler gcc and the gdb debugger are used. </p><p> Computer architecture is closely related to assembly language programming, as it is through assembly language programs that the architecture of a machine is made apparent. The presentation of the material breaks from the tradition of computer architecture texts in which assembly language programming was presented as a language in which one might write programs; with a knowledge of the computer architecture, there are, today, a number of high-level languages, such as C, which provide most of the capabilities of assembly language programming. The use of high-level languages results in much higher programmer efficiency and level of representation. It is, however, important to understand the machine at the assembly language level in order to write high-level programs intelligently: to decide between competing data and control structures, the use of global variables and function parameters, the use of recursion, nested procedures, etc. While many of these choices are influenced by high-level factors, the machine architecture has a profound effect on the computational efficiency of the resulting choice. </p><p> Although the machine language of a computer is easy to understand, its use results in vast quantities of numeric data that have little meaning. Related to the very heart of computer science is the use of symbol manipulation to simplify and to bring to a clear level of understanding the manipulation and generation of low-level numeric codes. Therefore, symbol manipulation is introduced in the first chapter in the form of the m4 macro processor. Throughout the remainder of the book macros are used to simplify and clarify what is being programmed. The generation of reams of assembly language code is discouraged in favor of the highest level of representation possible. </p><p> The computer is introduced by way of the calculator, as most students are familiar with calculators. We make use of the Hewlett-Packard programmable calculator, which reveals many details of machine architectures. The HP calculators have a natural machine language. Assembly language programming is introduced to generate calculator programs making use of m4. A more formal introduction to the machine is presented in the latter half of the first chapter. Stack, accumulator, and load/store machine architectures are also introduced in the first chapter. </p><p> The second chapter introduces the SPARC architecture so that students may start programming as early as possible. Like swimming, assembly language programming is not learned in a library! Making use of the machine registers for variable storage, students may start writing short programs by the end of the chapter. The assembler, as, is introduced along with gdb, the debugger. Formatted output is deferred until very late in the book to prevent students from developing the "insert a print statement" mode of program debugging. Instead, gdb is introduced as a natural way to examine memory and registers, and to execute programs. The assembler, as, lacks a macro expansion capability, as it was only designed to be an efficient final pass for the compiler, which has its own macro facilities. In general, we will use the assembler as a second pass to m4, which provides a macro facility. Branching is introduced in the second chapter, as it is difficult to write very interesting programs without branches. Together with branching, pipelining is introduced with the resulting need for delay slot instructions. As the initial specification of the SPARC architecture did not have a multiplication or division instruction, calls to the system routines .mul and .div, etc., are introduced in the second chapter without discussing what happens when the call is made. </p><p> As each of the architectural features of the machine is introduced it is related as closely as possible to C language constructs so that students learn the relationship between C and the resulting machine language structures. In the second chapter the control structures of C are introduced in assembly language form. In general, algorithms are written in C and then hand-coded into assembly language. Frequently, optimizations are then seen and the assembly language code optimized. However, we then return to C to learn how the optimized code might have been generated directly from C or why it could not. In this way students learn the problems that compiler writers must face and the reasons why many programs are written the way they are. </p><p> Once students are able to write and execute simple assembly language programs, binary logic and arithmetic are introduced. Chapter 3 introduces binary storage devices and number systems: binary, octal, and hexadecimal and their conversions. Bitwise logic operations are introduced and the use of the register %g0, which always yields a zero when used as a source register, effectively increasing the instruction set of the machine. Chapter 4 introduces modulus arithmetic and binary multiplication and division. The treatment of multiplication is fairly extensive, as it is needed to understand the multiply-step instruction of the SPARC architecture. Signed and unsigned comparisons are discussed. The chapter concludes with extended precision arithmetic. </p><p> Chapter 5 introduces the stack for the storage of variables. Frames are introduced to provide local storage for functions. The definition of variable offsets is discussed and problems of memory alignment and the load and store instructions. Macros are made use of in the definition of stack offsets and the adjustment of the stack pointer to provide storage. Variables are addressed relative to the frame pointer, which is natural for this architecture. We defer the use of static data until Chapter 9, as their use is clumsy with the SPARC architecture and is not representative of current programming practice. </p><p> Chapter 6 introduces multidimensional arrays and structures. Problems of array bound checking and lower bounds differing from zero are discussed along with the problems of dynamic arrays so that students understand the reasons for array addressing restrictions in C. Multiplication by constants for array subscripting is introduced and macros for the automatic generation of multiplication sequences developed in Appendix C. The simplicity of structure addressing is presented so that students understand that arrays, while conceptually simple, are usually a poor choice when structures may be used in their place. Macros are developed for the definition of structure fields and storage allocation. </p><p> Functions are then introduced, with discussion of the following: register sets, subroutine linkage, arguments, and return values. Examples are given of simple function calls and of function calls with many arguments or that return aggregates. Finally, leaf routines are presented with their limited register usage. </p><p> Chapter 8 introduces the machine language of the SPARC architecture and presents the concepts of instruction decoding and operand access. The handling of 32-bit constants is presented together with program counter relative addressing. </p><p> In Chapter 9, global data, initialized data, and addressing methods are discussed. ASCII strings are introduced and formatted output discussed. The switch C statement's translation into assembly language is introduced in this chapter. The handling of C command line arguments is presented along with linking with other code. </p><p> Chapter 10 discusses input/output from character devices up through I/O processors. The chapter concludes with a section on system input/output using traps. </p><p> It is not until Chapter 11 that floating-point is introduced. Floating-point may be left out of a course without affecting the other material. The concept of additional processors with multiple functional units is discussed as well as the interlocking of the floating-point processor with the integer unit. Single, double, and extended precision number formats are described along with NaN's (not a number) and subnormal numbers. </p><p>Chapter 12 discusses supervisor mode, processor state registers, and traps. Register window saving by means of traps is discussed in detail. Interrupts are introduced together with hardware traps. This chapter may also be left out of a course without detracting from the other material. </p><p> Chapter 13 introduces sharing of the processor between many users and the mechanisms for so doing. Sharing memory is of primary importance and the SPARC virtual memory mapping, translation lookaside buffer, and cache memory system are presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion of context switching. </p><p> Chapter 14 presents some alternative architectures, the PDP-11 for historical interest, the VAX as an example of a CISC machine, and the MIPS RISC machine as a contemporary architecture. This chapter may also be left out of a course without detracting from the other</p></p><h2>The War on Cancer: An Anatomy of Failure, A Blueprint for the Future</h2><p><p>After reviewing the history of cancer and its impact on the population, Dr. Faguet exposes the antiquated notions that have driven cancer drug development, documents the stagnation in treatment outcomes despite major advances in cancer genomics and growing NCI budgets, and identifies the multiple factors that sustain the status quo. He shows that, contrary to frequent announcements of breakthroughs, our current cancer control model cannot eradicate most cancers and the reasons why. Significantly, this book also delineates a way forward via a shift from the discredited cell-kill approach of the past to an integrated, evidence-driven cancer control paradigm based on prevention, early diagnosis, and pharmacogenomics. The author's views are based on data published in mainstream scientific journals and other reliable references, 432 of which are cited.</p></p><p><p>From the reviews:</p> <p>"I am quite impressed with the scope of the effort, the excellent writing, and the sharp&nbsp;and accurate critique over a broad area of modern oncology practice and research. Frankly, I am not aware of many scientists who could synthesize both the basic and clinical material, and lucidly&nbsp;depict the implications in such a compelling manner". (Neil Caporaso, M.D., Chief, Pharmacogenetics Section, Genetic Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, MD.)</p> <p>From the reviews:</p> <p>"Dr Faguet's approach is not unlike an analysis of the so-called industrial military complex....a complex consisting of the federal government, pharmaceutical drug companies and academia&#x2015;all have a part of the pie and therefore a reason for maintaining the status quo. Insurance companies, regulatory agencies such as the FDA, and patients themselves add further layers of complexity. Faguet walks through all of these areas in a critical but unemotional manner... His book should be of interest to policy-makers, cancer-care workers, and the public at large". (Gerald E. Marti, M.D., Ph.D. Chief, Flow and Image Cytometry Section, Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, National Institutes of Health MD.) </p> <p>From the reviews:</p> <p>"I think your book will be a valuable corrective to much of the hype that has been splashed around in greater and greater quantities by the cancer establishment as it tries to stifle the message that it has failed to make much of an impact" (John C. Bailar, M.D., Ph.D., Former Deputy Associate Director for Cancer Control, National Cancer Institute; Former Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute; Professor Emeritus, University of Chicago, IL.)</p> <p>From the reviews:</p> <p>"The War on cancer is a trenchant and provocative book that offers a critical view of the last four decades in the field of oncology and a vision for the future.

Solutions to the problems are developed using the language C and the author's signature five-step problem solving process. <b> </b> Centered around a theme of oceans and their role in the complex interactions of environment, the book enables readers to solve real-world and scientific problems. Four types of exercises are presented to develop problem-solving skills - Practice! problems, Modify! problems, Short-Answer problems, and Programming problems. Coverage of essential features that are needed to write reusable C code are included such as C structures and pointers. The book also provides an introduction to object-oriented programming and C++. <b> </b> For engineers and scientists who want to use ANSI C to solve practical engineering and scientific problems. </p></p><p>Preface <p> Engineers use computers to solve a variety of problems ranging from the evaluation of a simple function to solving a system of nonlinear equations. C has become the language of choice of many engineers and scientists not only because it has powerful commands and data structures, but also because it can easily be used for system-level operations. Since C is the language that a new engineer is most likely to encounter in a job, it is a good choice for an introduction to computing for engineers. Therefore, this text was written to introduce engineering problem solving with the following objectives:</p><p>to develop a consistent methodology for solving engineering problems, to present the fundamental capabilities of C, the language of choice of many practicing engineers and scientists, and to illustrate the problem solving process with C through a variety of engineering examples and applications. </p><p> To accomplish these objectives, Chapter 1 presents a five-step process that is used consistently in the rest of the text for solving engineering problems. Chapters 2-7 present the fundamental capabilities of C for solving engineering problems. Chapter 8 is a brief introduction to Object-Oriented Programming using C++. Object-oriented programming is gaining popularity in many fields of engineering and science and is likely to be seen in the workplace. Chapter 8 is intended to familiarize readers with some of the basic object-oriented features of C++. Throughout all these chapters, we present a large number of examples from many different engineering and science disciplines. The solutions to these examples are developed using the five-step process and ANSI C (and ANSI C++ in Chapter 8), the standards developed by the American National Standards Institute. CHANGES TO THE SECOND EDITION </p><p> This second edition is in response to the insightful comments of our readers and reviewers. It includes a reorganization of some topics and the addition of new topics. The second edition moves the discussion of character data up to Chapter 2 and moves the discussion of character strings up to Chapter 5. Two new chapters have been added to the text; a chapter on structures and a chapter introducing the C++ programming language. We have added a new section of problems, titled Exam Practice! to the end of each chapter and have added new end-of-chapter exercises to many of the chapters. New engineering application problems, including simulation, image processing, and complex numbers, have been added to the text, as well as additional numerical techniques, including the Newton-Raphson method and numerical integration using the Trapezoid Rule. New algorithms include the sequential search and the binary search. Our objectives and our approach to engineering problem solving remain the same. PREREQUISITES </p><p> No prior experience with the computer is assumed. The mathematical prerequisites are college algebra and trigonometry. Of course, the initial material can be covered much faster if the student has used other computer languages or software tools. COURSE STRUCTURE </p><p> The material in these chapters was selected to provide the basis for a one-term course in engineering computing. These chapters contain the essential topics of mathematical computations, character data, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, and structures. Students with background in another computer language should be able to complete this material in less than a semester. A minimal course that provides only an introduction to C can be designed using the nonoptional sections of the text. (Optional sections are indicated in the Contents.) Three ways to use the text, along with the recommended chapter sections, are</p><p>Introduction to C Many freshman introductory courses introduce the student to several computer tools in addition to an introduction to a language. For these courses, we recommend covering the nonoptional sections of Chapters 1-5. This material introduces students to the fundamental capabilities of C, and they will be able to write substantial programs using mathematical computations, character data, control structures, functions, and arrays. Problem Solving with C In a semester course devoted specifically to teaching students to master the C language, we recommend covering all nonoptional sections of Chapters 1-7. This material covers all the fundamental concepts of the C language, including mathematical computations, character data, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, and structures. Problem Solving with C and Numerical Techniques Upper-level students or students who are already familiar with other high-level languages will be able to cover the material in this text very quickly. In addition, they will be able to apply the numerical technique material to their other courses. Therefore, we recommend that these students cover all sections of Chapters 1-7, including the optional material. </p><p> Many students may be interested in reading about some of the additional object-oriented features found in C++. We recommend that students cover all nonoptional sections of Chapters 1-7 before reading Chapter 8. PROBLEM-SOLVING METHODOLOGY </p><p> The emphasis on engineering and scientific problem solving is an integral part of the text. Chapter 1 introduces a five-step process for solving engineering problems using the computer: </p><p> 1. State the problem clearly. 2. Describe the input and output information. 3. Work a simple example by hand. 4. Develop an algorithm and convert it to a computer program. 5. Test the solution with a variety of data. </p><p> To reinforce the development of problem-solving skills, each of these five steps is clearly identified each time that a complete engineering problem is solved. In addition, top-down design and stepwise refinement are presented with the use of decomposition outlines, pseudocode, and flowcharts. ENGINEERING AND SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS </p><p> Throughout the text, emphasis is placed on incorporating real-world engineering and scientific examples and problems. This emphasis is centered around a theme of grand challenges, which include the following:</p><p>prediction of weather, climate, and global change computerized speech understanding mapping of the human genome improvements in vehicle performance enhanced oil and gas recovery simulation </p><p> Each chapter begins with a photograph and a discussion of some aspect of one of these grand challenges that provides a glimpse of some of the exciting and interesting areas in which engineers might work. Later in the chapter, we solve a problem that not only relates to the introductory problem, but also has applications in other problem solutions. The grand challenges are also referenced in many of the other examples and problems. ANSI C </p><p> The statements presented and all programs developed use the C standards developed by the American National Standards Institute. By using ANSI C, students learn to write portable code that can be transferred from one computer platform to another. Many of the capabilities are discussed in the text, and additional ones are discussed in Appendix A. SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CONCEPTS </p><p> Engineers and scientists are expected to develop and implement user-friendly and reusable computer solutions. Learning software engineering techniques is therefore crucial to successfully developing these computer solutions. Readability and documentation are stressed in the development of programs. Additional topics that relate to software engineering issues are discussed throughout the text and include issues such as software life cycle, portability, maintenance, modularity, recursion, abstraction, reusability, structured programming, validation, and verification. FOUR TYPES OF PROBLEMS </p><p> Learning any new skill requires practice at a number of different levels of difficulty. We have developed four types of exercises that are used throughout the text to develop problem-solving skills. The first set of exercises is Practice! problems. These are short-answer questions that relate to the section of material just presented. Most sections are immediately followed by a set of Practice! problems so that students can determine if they are ready to continue to the next section. Complete solutions to all the Practice! problems are included at the end of the text. </p><p> The Modify! problems are designed to provide hands-on experiences with the programs developed in the Problem Solving Applied sections. In these sections, we develop a complete C program using the five-step process. The Modify! problems ask students to run the program with different sets of data to test their understanding of how the program works and of the relationships among the engineering variables. These exercises also ask the students to make simple modifications to the program and then run the program to test their changes. Selected solutions to some of the Modify! problems are included at the end of the text. </p><p> Each chapter ends with a set of Exam Practice! problems and a set of end-of-chapter problems. The Exam Practice! problems are short-answer questions that relate to the material covered in the chapter. These problems help students determine how well they understand the features of C presented in the chapter. The end-of-chapter problems are new problems that relate to a variety of engineering applications, and the level of difficulty ranges from very straightforward to longer project assignments. Each problem requires that the student develop a complete C program or function. Engineering data sets are included for many of the problems to use in testing. Selected solutions to some of the Exam Practice! and end-of-chapter problems are included at the end of the text. STUDY AND PROGRAMMING AIDS </p><p> Margin notes are used to help the reader not only identify the important concepts, but also to easily locate specific topics. In addition, margin notes are used to identify programming style guidelines and debugging information. Style guidelines show students how to write C programs that incorporate good software discipline; debugging sections help students recognize common errors so that they can avoid them. </p><p> The programming style notes are indicated with the margin note ,I&gt;Style, and the debugging notes are indicated with a bug icon. Each Chapter Summary contains a summary of the style notes and debugging notes, plus a list of the Key Terms from the chapter and a C Statement Summary of the new statements to make the book easier to use as a reference. The combined list of these key terms, along with their definitions, is included in a Glossary at the end of the text. OPTIONAL NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES </p><p> Numerical techniques that are commonly used in solving engineering problems are also discussed in optional sections in the chapters, and include interpolation, linear modeling (regression), root finding, numerical integration, and the solution to simultaneous equations. The concept of a matrix is also introduced and then illustrated using a number of examples. All of these topics are presented assuming only a trigonometry and college algebra background. MATLAB AND VISUALIZATION </p><p> The visualization of the information related to a problem and its solution is a critical component in understanding and developing the intuition necessary to be a creative engineer. Therefore, we have included a number of plots of data throughout the text to illustrate the relationships of the information needed to solve specific problems. All the plots were generated using MATLAB, a powerful environment for numerical computations, data analysis, and visualization. We have also included an appendix that shows how to generate a simple plot from data that have been stored in an ASCII data file; this ASCII file could be generated with a word processor or it could be generated by a C program. If a course is planned that will include material on both C and MATLAB, a special package that includes this text and Engineering Problem Solving with MATLAB is available from Prentice Hall. APPENDICES </p><p> To further enhance reference use, the appendices include a number of important topics. Appendix A contains a discussion of the components in the ANSI C Standard Library. Appendix B presents the ASCII character codes. Appendix C shows how to use MATLAB to plot data from ASCII files; this allows students to generate ASCII files with their C programs and to then plot the values using MATLAB. Finally, Appendix D contains a list of references used throughout the text. INSTRUCTOR'S RESOURCE CD </p><p> An Instructor's Resource CD is available, which contains complete solutions to all the Modify! problems and end-of-chapter problems, as well as data files to use with application problems. A complete set of Power Point slides is included to assist the instructor in preparing lecture material. NONTECHNICAL SKILLS </p><p> The engineer of the 21st century needs many skills and capabilities in addition to the technical ones learned in an engineering program. In Chapter 1 we present a brief discussion on some of these nontechnical skills that are so important to engineers. Specifically, we discuss developing both oral and written communications skills, understanding the design/process/manufacture path that takes an idea and leads to a product, working in interdisciplinary teams, understanding the world and its marketplace, the importance of synthesis as well as analysis, and the importance of ethics and other societal concerns in engineering solutions. While this text is devoted primarily to teaching problem solving skills and the C language, we have attempted to tie these other nontechnical topics into many of the problems and discussions in the text.</p><p> </p><ul> <li>To develop a consistent methodology for solving engineering problems</li>. <p> </p><li>To present the fundamental capabilities of C, the language of choice of many practicing engineers and scientists</li>. <p> </p><li>To illustrate the problem solving process with C through a variety of engineering examples and applications</li>. <p> </p><li>Introduces the topics of character data and the discussion of C strings early</li>. <p> </p><li>Adds chapters on: structures and C++ Programming language</li>. <p> </p><li>Includes a new section of problems for each chapter</li>. <p> </p><li>Provides new engineering application problems: Simulation, Image Processing, and Complex Number</li>. <p> </p><li>Offers an Instructor's Resource CD-ROM to supplement text</li>. <p> </p><li>Companion Website available at www.prenhall.com/etter</li> </ul></p><h2>Young America: The Flowering of Democracy in New York City</h2><p>This fascinating study examines the meteoric career of a vigorous intellectual movement rising out of the Age of Jackson. As Americans argued over their destiny in the decades preceding the Civil War, an outspoken new generation of "ultra-democratic" writers entered the fray, staking out positions on politics, literature, art, and any other territory they could annex. They called themselves Young America--and they proclaimed a "Manifest Destiny" to push back frontiers in every category of achievement. Their swagger found a natural home in New York City, already bursting at the seams and ready to take on the world.<br><br>Young America's mouthpiece was the <em>Democratic Review</em>, a highly influential magazine funded by the Democratic Party and edited by the brash and charismatic John O'Sullivan. The <em>Review</em> offered a fresh voice in political journalism, and sponsored young writers like Hawthorne and Whitman early in their careers. Melville, too, was influenced by Young America, and provided a running commentary on its many excesses. Despite brilliant promise, the movement fell apart in the 1850s, leaving its original leaders troubled over the darker destiny they had ushered in. Their ambitious generation had failed to rewrite history as promised. Instead, their perpetual agitation helped set the stage for the Civil War.<br><br><em>Young America: The Flowering of Democracy in New York City</em> is without question the most complete examination of this captivating and original movement. It also provides the first published biography of its leader, John O'Sullivan, one of America's great rhetoricians. Edward L. Widmer enriches his unique volume by offering a new theory of Manifest Destiny as part of a broader movement of intellectual expansion in nineteenth-century America.<br></p><p>Most people have probably never heard of John O'Sullivan, who launched a magazine called <i>Democratic Review</i> in 1837 with money provided by the Democratic Party, or of the "Young America" movement the magazine spearheaded. But one of the phrases that emerged from Sullivan's writing--"Manifest Destiny"--has entered the American lexicon, although in a much more limited form than its author intended. When O'Sullivan wrote in 1838, "It is manifest that the reaction now apparent over the whole length and breadth of the land is a great national movement that must go on," he had in mind not merely the expansion of political boundaries but a broad cultural dissemination of democratic principles that encompassed literature and other arts.<p> Edward L. Widmer's effective combination of history and literary criticism sheds much-needed light on an intellectual movement that captured many sons and grandsons of the American Revolution, including Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman (and, although he would always maintain a critical distance, Herman Melville). <i>Young America</i> vividly depicts the United States in the tumultuous years between the presidency of Andrew Jackson and the Civil War, an era in which politics <i>was</i> America's popular culture.</p><br><strong>Edward L. Widmer</strong> has taught at Harvard University and the Rhode Island School of Design, and received fellowships from the Mellon Foundation, the John Carter Brown Library, and the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research. He is currently a White House speechwriter and lives in Washington with his wife and son.<br></p><h2>Effective Teaching in Elementary Social Studies (6th Edition)</h2><p><b> </b> The sixth edition of this popular book helps readers aid children in developing thinking skills and master principles, encouraging them to understand the world, approach challenges from different perspectives, and understand and stand firm in the face of injustice.

This book looks at the kind of antisemitism which is tolerated or which goes unacknowledged in apparently democratic spaces: trade unions, churches, left-wing and liberal politics, social gatherings of the chattering classes and the seminars and journals of radical intellectuals. It analyses how criticism of Israel can mushroom into antisemitism and it looks at struggles over how antisemitism is defined. It focuses on ways in which those who raise the issue of antisemitism are often accused of doing so in bad faith in an attempt to silence or smear.

Having participated in quite a few of the events and debates which he recounts, Hirsh has done a commendable service by deftly highlighting an ugly vein of bigotry that disfigures some substantial portions of the political left in the UK and beyond." &#x2015; <i>Matthew H. Kramer FBA, Professor of Legal &amp; Political Philosophy, Cambridge University, UK</i></p><i> <p></p></i> <p> "A fierce and brilliant rebuttal of one of the Left's most pertinacious obsessions. What makes David Hirsh the perfect analyst of this disorder is his first-hand knowledge of the ideologies and dogmata that sustain it." - <i>Howard Jacobson, Novelist and Visiting Professor at New College of Humanities, London, UK</i></p><i> <p></p> </i><p><i>"</i>David Hirsh's new book "Contemporary Left Anti-Semitism" is an important contribution to the literature on the longest hatred. Coming at a time when there is appropriate attention to a resurgence of populist, classic right-wing anti-Semitism, Hirsh's work is a reminder that there is no ideological monopoly on anti-Semitism. As he delineates in detail, using Britain as a jumping off point but speaking more broadly, left-wing anti-Semitism is more challenging to identify but is no less pernicious than its right-wing counterpart. In a highly polarized world, understanding anti-Semitism from wherever it emerges is more vital than ever. Hirsh makes a large contribution toward that imperative." - <i>Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO, Anti-Defamation League, USA</i> </p> <p></p> <p>"David Hirsh has rightfully emerged as an important voice on the issue of contemporary antisemitsm. He writes with passion but with balance and offers insights, to which we may have been previously oblivious, but, after reading what he has to say, seem utterly obvious. This book is not just for those who care about prejudice and antisemitism. It is also a must read for anyone who cares about the contemporary political landscape. It is a wakeup call for those who believe in the ideals and objective of leftist politics." - <em>Deborah Lipstadt, Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish History and Holocaust Studies, Emory University, United States</em></p> <p>"David Hirsh is not only one of the foremost analysts and authorities on contemporary antisemitism, he is also one of its most redoubtable opponents." <i>Mark Gardner, Director of Communications, CST, UK</i></p> <p></p> <p>"David Hirsh is a relentless investigator into one of the darker corners of contemporary left discourse, always shining a probing, revealing light." <i>Jonathan Freedland, Author and Journalist, The Guardian, UK</i></p> <p></p> <p>"The rise of anti-Semitism on the British left -- which reached its apex in Jeremy Corbyn's capturing the leadership of the Labour Party -- is one of the most confounding, and worrisome, developments in contemporary Western politics. A man of the left himself, David Hirsh understands this phenomenon better than anyone, and has the battle scars to prove it." <i>James Kirchick, Foreign Policy Analyst and Journalist, USA </i></p> <p>"David embodies what academia should be about - nuance, balance, careful evaluation of the merits of every perspective put forward, when disagreeing, doing so in a measured, respectful manner that deals with the issues not personalities, a willingness to subject his views to rigorous critical scrutiny and where called for adjust his views accordingly - he puts all too many of his academic humanities colleagues to shame. Listening to him is an intellectual treat. This fight is about more than Israel. It's about restoring intellectual honesty and professional integrity to the world's institutions of higher learning, which have largely been hijacked by intellectual frauds, moral charlatans and witch-hunting ideological bullies." - <em>Wendy Kahn, National Director, South African Jewish Board of Deputies.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>"In his book <i>Contemporary Left Antisemitism</i> David Hirsh proves himself to be our foremost diagnostician of a dangerous malaise: antisemitism among people who consider themselves progressive and antiracist. Building on masterly analyses of a series of contemporary case-studies, and approaching antisemitism as a sociocultural and institutional framework rather than a product of individual prejudice, Hirsh exposes the hostile assumptions and defensive obfuscations of left antisemitic discourse, from the continued use of blood libel and conspiracy theories to the implication of inherent deviousness to Jewish motives &#x2013; the historically shocking observation that many antiracists &#x2018;have been educated to recognize the <i>accusation </i>of antisemitism, rather than the antisemitism itself, as the dirty trick&#x2019;. Honest, precise and unwavering, Hirsh&#x2019;s writing is publicly-engaged scholarship at its best. This deeply insightful book is indispensable not only for those wishing to understand contemporary left antisemitism, but for anyone concerned with the moral health of democratic political culture." - <em>Paul Frosh, Department of Communication and Journalism, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</em></p> <p><em></em>&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Contemporary Left Antisemitism</i>, David Hirsh takes on those in Britain and elsewhere who have embraced an anti-imperialist and anti-neoliberal political view and think of themselves as members of the community of the good, but in recent decades have also embraced toxic ways of imagining most Jews. Such "progressives" participate in antisemitism even as they insist they stand against it. They practice a discursive intolerance, expressed in insults, exclusions, purges, and boycott; at the same time, they accuse Jews of crying antisemitism in bad faith.They pour new life into a powerful tradition of accusing the Jew, updating it for a new era.</p> <p>Hirsh further suggests that the new antisemitism cloaked as antizionism emerges when progressive politics are shaped by identity and position rather than by commitment to shared democratic values. These good folks think in simple binaries casting Israel as bad and Jews as privileged. The world they see is divided by opposed camps and they cast their lot uncritically with the victimized and the resistant.</p> <p>Hirsh&#x2019;s study is a useful guide to this new politics and intolerance, which has spread in recent years also to the United States and especially to its universities. Hirsh&#x2019;s account teases out its key features and assays its impacts &#x2013; on unions, the courts, the Labour Party, the universities. It is also a powerful story of marginalization and the effort by a brilliant scholar to define an empirical methodology for study of antisemitism and to speak back effectively against bigotry. - <em>Ken Waltzer, Professor Emeritus, Social Relations and Policy, Michigan State University</em></p> <p>'The empirical richness of the study is, not surprisingly, impressive.' - <em>Lars Rensmann, Antisemitism Studies</em></p><i> <p> </p></i></p><h2>Napoleon on the Art of War</h2><p>Gathers selections from Napoleon&#39;s letters and writings to depict his views on war preparations, military education, generalship, army organization, strategy, fortification, and field operations</p><p>Jay Luvaas is a leading military historian and editor and translator of FREDERICK THE GREAT ON THE ART OF WAR.

So concludes Nicholas Cull in this absorbing study of how the United States was transformed from isolationism to belligerence in the years before the attack on Pearl Harbor. From the moment it realized that all was lost without American aid, the British Government employed a host of persuasive tactics to draw the US to its rescue. With the help of talents as varied as those of matinee idol Leslie Howard, Oxford philosopher Isaiah Berlin and society photographer Cecil Beaton, no section of America remained untouched and no method--from Secret Service intrigue to the publication of horrifying pictures of Nazi atrocities--remained untried. The British sought and won the support of key journalists and broadcasters, including Edward R. Murrow, Dorothy Thompson and Walter Winchell; Hollywood film makers also played a willing part. Cull details these and other propaganda activities, covering the entire range of the British effort. A fascinating story of how a <em>foreign</em> country provoked America's involvement in its greatest war, <em>Selling War</em> will appeal to all those interested in the modern cultural and political history of Britain and the United States.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nicholas John Cull</strong> is Professor of American Studies at the University of Leicester.<br><br>"Nicholas John Cull has made a major study of Britain's potent efforts to get a reluctant United States to fight."--<em>International Herald Tribune</em><p></p><br>"[T]his is a sensible, thoughtful, and--in revealing the foibles of many key actors--an often amusing book."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Cull writes with wit and zest about the efforts of Britons to help Roosevelt to bring the USA into the war....Based on careful research in many archives, this book provides a definitive account of important factors bearing on a decisive moment in world history."--Angus Calder, author of <em>The</em> <em>People's War</em> and <em>The Myth of the Blitz</em><p></p><br>"Dr. Cull has written a fascinatingly detailed, if triumphalist, account of how the Special Relationship worked, when it was vital for Britain that it should, with America's Anglophiles and Britain's Americophiles working together to bring American opinion to see where America's true interests lay--in meeting tyranny on its own ground rather than sheltering behind a mythical Fortress America.

Her life illustrates the opportunities and limitations that faced women participating in American politics during the early twentieth century. Unlike many other veterans of the fight for suffrage, McCormick learned the techniques of politics early from her father, Senator Marcus A. Hanna, McKinley's legendary campaign manager. Her political apprenticeship continued under her husband, Medill McCormick, Chicago Tribune scion, and a leader in Progressive and Republican circles.<br>Associated with the major figures and pivotal events of U. S. history for nearly fifty years, McCormick was the first woman elected to a national statewide office, the first nominated by a major party for the Senate, and the first to manage a presidential nomination campaign, that of Thomas Dewey. Unique though McCormick's accomplishments were, she shared with other modern women the problems of balancing personal ambition with the demands of husband, children, and social expectations. Hers is the story of a vital, engaging, and complex woman and sheds new light on women's political and social history.</p><p></p><h2>Digital Theory and Practice Using Integrated Circuits</h2><p>Hardcover: 400 pages Publisher: Prentice Hall; 1St Edition edition (June 1978) Language: English</p><p></p><h2>Olafur Eliasson &amp; David Adjaye: Your Black Horizon: Art Pavillon</h2><p>Olafur Eliasson, one of today&#x2019;s most acclaimed contemporary artists, and David Adjaye, a rising architecture star, have engaged in a unique collaboration.

He is the author of several books and many articles and reviews on Dutch art of the Golden Age.<br>This lavishly produced book attempts to explicate the mysterious allure of 17th-century Dutch genre pictures, which were painted most famously by Johannes Vermeer. Syracuse professor Frantis frames these works in a historical context to demonstrate how audiences of the period would have interpreted them. The author explains how many of the objects portrayed in these works had coded meanings that are lost on modern audiences. For example, birds, oyster shells and cats were widely recognized as symbols of sex, while subject poses that look awkward to contemporary eyes were actually considered the height of dignified comportment by Dutch art patrons. Frantis also traces the history of Holland and the development of its art, arguing that the two are closely linked. His argument is that, as the country became wealthier, the subject matter of its paintings became increasingly refined, changing from satirical portraits of raucous, lazy peasants to elegant images of upper classes at play. In Frantis&#x2019;s opinion, both portrayals are constructed types, and neither reflects the reality of Dutch life in the 17th century. To back up his thesis, Frantis has done impressive research into the culture of the period, examining its literature, songs, guides of behavior and poems. At the same time, he doesn&#x2019;t neglect the paintings&#x2019; formal elements, deftly analyzing the artists&#x2019; influences, color schemes and use of tools like camera obscura. As convincing as Frantis&#x2019;s interpretation is, it breaks down when applied to the work of two masters, Jan Steen and Vermeer. To Frantis&#x2019;s credit, he acknowledges this discrepancy, giving the inexplicability of artistic genius its due. 230 b/w &amp; 100 color illus.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He writes, &#39;Things happen for people in art therapy groups that really are almost magical.&#39; The author&#39;s approach is to simultaneously explore how this magic occurs while still honoring the mystery and power of interpersonal art making. Through the author&#39;s effective use of storytelling, the reader encounters the group art therapy experience, transcending the case vignette and didactic instruction. Through his personal disclosures and vivid descriptions of amalgamated clinical situations, the reader is invited into art therapy sessions and given access to the mind, the heart, and the soul of the therapist. The book helps group leaders answer such questions as: Should I have a directive? How structured should the group be and how open-ended? Do all the group members have to work on the same task or should they work individually? What do I say, when do I say it, and how should I say it? Do I have to use language at all? How is this particular project therapeutic? The author encourages the art therapist to not look outside for validation, but rather to look from within. By placing the art at the center of practice, Art-Based Group Therapy creates an explanatory model and rationale for group practice that is rooted in art therapy theory and identity. The book will be of benefit to students, practitioners, and educators alike. Using it as a guide, art therapy students may be more empowered to enter into the uncertain terrains of their practica grounded in a theory soundly based in their area of study. Practitioners will no doubt be encouraged, validated, and inspired to continue their work. Educators can employ the twelve principles, as they teach the basic theories and applications of group dynamics and processes. Advocates and practitioners must continually explain, evaluate, and communicate what they do; the author succeeds in establishing a framework that allows art therapists to communicate the value of their work in a language that is unique to art therapy.</p><p>In his second edition of <i>Art-Based Group Therapy</i>, Bruce Moon paints a vivid picture of an effective group leader while taking his readers on a thought provoking journey through his 30-plus years of successes and struggles in leading art-based therapy groups.<br><br>With the gentle guidance of a seasoned therapist, Moon invites readers to join him in examining the invaluable characteristics of the art-based therapy group.<br><br>Moon notes early on that this book is not meant to provide particular art tasks or cook-book descriptions of group directives, and he indeed provides so much more.<br><br>With a tone of empowerment that permeates each chapter, Moon urges group leaders to reconsider the traditional beliefs that talking is necessary in order for growth to occur and that therapists should maintain a detached, opaque demeanor in order to help their clients.<br><br>I highly recommend this book to art therapists, art-based group leaders, as well as faculty and students in graduate art therapy programs. Not only is <i>Art-Based Group Therapy</i> well written, easy to follow and visually stimulating, it is written the way a good class should be taught by providing stimuli that appeal to different types of learners and reinforcing ideas through visual images, stories and practical applications. --Erin Blair-Journal of Applied Arts &amp; Health, May 2017</p><h2>Understanding RTI in Mathematics: Proven Methods and Applications</h2><p><p>Response to intervention&#x2014;it's already improving reading outcomes in classrooms across the country, and this approach can be equally effective for K&#x2013;12 mathematics instruction.

David Cressy reviews the information available to prospective migrants, the decisions they had to reach and the actions necessary before they could settle in America. English men and women moved to New England with a variety of motives, and in a multitude of circumstances. &#39;Puritanism&#39;, involving religious harassment in England and the desire to follow God&#39;s ordinances in America, was only one of many factors impelling people to move. Rather than developing in wilderness isolation, the society and culture of seventeenth-century New England were constantly shaped by their English roots. A two-way flow of correspondence, messages and information linked colonists to their homeland. Family duties, political sympathies, friendships, business and legal obligations all led to a continuing attachment across the Atlantic. In treating early America from a British perspective, as a part of English history, Professor Cressy provides us with many insights into the seventeenth century.</p><p>Coming Over discusses the English migration to New England in the seventeenth century and shows the importance of English connections in the lives of American colonists.

An ardent opera lover in his youth, Brecht later denounced the genre as decadent and irrelevant to modern society even as he continued to work on opera projects throughout his career. He completed three operas and attempted two dozen more with composers such as Kurt Weill, Paul Hindemith, Hanns Eisler, and Paul Dessau. Joy H. Calico argues that Brecht's simultaneous work on opera and <i>Lehrst�ck </i>in the 1920s generated the new concept of audience experience that would come to define epic theater, and that his revisions to the theory of <i>Gestus </i>in the mid-1930s are reminiscent of nineteenth-century opera performance practices of mimesis.</p><p>"<i>Brecht at the Opera </i>is a remarkably compelling and exciting book. It not only explains why Brecht's relationship to opera is so vexed, it complicates the formulaic terms by which we have come to understand that vexation&#x2015;extending, deepening, and refining our sense of the place of music in Brecht's projects as well as Brecht's place in the history of opera. It is amazingly thorough, very well written, and exceedingly provocative."&#x2015;David J. Levin, author of <i>Unsettling Opera</i><br><br>"Calico strikes a subtle balance between attentive elucidation of Brecht's theories and a less obedient exploration of the ways his achievements were grounded in an operatic tradition that he (and most later commentators) have preferred to dismiss as antiquated and irrelevant. The author offers the clearest account I have read of the concept of Gestus and&#x2015;in a move that might have pleased Brecht himself quite a bit&#x2015;takes on the promiscuous use of the label 'Brechtian' in recent criticism. The book's final chapter, a lively and personal meditation on what kinds of staging might really produce an effect of estrangement, is likely to become an energizing point of reference for those of us who write about opera in performance."&#x2015;Mary Ann Smart, author of <i>Mimomania: Music and Gesture in Nineteenth-Century Opera</i><br><br>"In this first systematic, English-language study on Brecht and the opera, Joy Calico provides a carefully documented reconstruction of his lifelong engagement with the genre. The book provides a compelling argument that Brecht's modernist theater practices can be traced back to his early resistance to the emotionalized experience engendered by musical theater."&#x2015;Marc Silberman, University of Wisconsin, Madison<b>Joy H.

Classicists have long decried Medieval Latin as the regrettable devolution of a formerly glorious language. Such an attitude is, of course, as fallacious as it is ill-informed, and the perspicacious scholar of Latin has realized the wealth of delightful material there is available in the corpus of 'medieval Latin' for study and instruction, and the great number of medieval texts that will delight, amuse, touch, and inspire the eager Latinist. In his <i>Medieval Mosaic: A Book of Medieval Latin Readings</i>, A. W. Godfrey has afforded the student of Latin in both high school and college the opportunity to sample some of the best and most beloved Latin Literature from Middle Ages, and the generosity of his selection is assurance that there will be a rich variety of textual appeal. To be sure, from the 'age of faith,' many of the readings assume a religious or miraculous cast, but that should not deter anyone from use of the book: such readings are the authentic voice of the era, and to hold fast to historical accuracy, a book of Medieval Latin readings would be fraudulent if they were not readings incorporating religious sentiments. However there are also other genres represented in <i>Medieval Mosaic</i>: the earthy poems of folk life from the <i>Carmina Burana</i>; the self-absorbed musings of the philosopher Abelard in his memoir <i>History of my Misfortunes</i>, and the colorful recollections of the indiscreet Gregory of Tours in his <i>History of the Franks</i>. Godfrey also performs a great service to the Latin student by including material from every medieval century, the fourth the fifteenth, so that students are able not only to enjoy a wide survey of Medieval Latin material, but also to observe the subtle shifts in the Latin language as it moved progressively away from common parlance and into the revered halls of cathedral schools and universities. The collection of readings is prefaced with a perhaps too brief review of Medieval Latin philology, but, with the student of classical Latin in mind, Godfrey demonstrates some of the syntatical and semantic shifts that occurred in the language naturally over time. Each page is footed with a simple apparatus of the specifics of translation, or clarification of theme or imagery in the 'Supra' reading; each reading is prefaced with a brief mention of historical context of both author (if known) and the content to be read. The volume closes with abbreviated addenda that comprise a list of specifically Medieval Latin words, and a bibliography of medieval history and Medieval Latin anthologies: one would have hoped for lists of wider scope and annotation. Nonetheless, <i>Medieval Mosaic</i> is an appropriate and engaging compilation for use by intermediate Latin students, and it is a wonderful venue with which to introduce students to the notion of Latin as an organic idiom, one that did not die with the passing of Tacitus or Lucan, but persisted for centuries in diverse and novel venues. --June-Ann Greeley, The Classical Outlook</p><h2>Millennials with Kids: Marketing to This Powerful and Surprisingly Different Generation of Parents</h2><p>While everyone was bemoaning their alleged laziness and self-absorption, the Millennial generation quietly grew up.

There is much to be gained from the playing of duets. Each player learns how to listen to the other, and in a short time develops an awareness of balance, musical phrasing, intonation, and tone quality. This type of training is excellent preparation for participation in large groups. These four volumes of duets for two violins will help fill the need for early ensemble experience in the public schools. They should be used in string classes as a supplement to any of the standard string methods. They will also encourage music making outside of the school, with parents or with other students. These duets are ideal for recitals in the public schools and in public school festivals. They may be played by two performers, or by multiple performers on each part, with or without piano accompaniment.</p><p></p><h2>Memory for Forgetfulness: August, Beirut, 1982 (Literature of the Middle East)</h2><p>One of the Arab world's greatest poets uses the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the shelling of Beirut as the setting for this sequence of prose poems.

As fighter jets scream overhead, he explores the war-ravaged streets of Beirut on August 6th (Hiroshima Day).<br><br><i>Memory for Forgetfulness</i> is an extended reflection on the invasion and its political and historical dimensions. It is also a journey into personal and collective memory. What is the meaning of exile? What is the role of the writer in time of war? What is the relationship of writing (memory) to history (forgetfulness)? In raising these questions, Darwish implicitly connects writing, homeland, meaning, and resistance in an ironic, condensed work that combines wit with rage.<br><br>Ibrahim Muhawi's translation beautifully renders Darwish's testament to the heroism of a people under siege, and to Palestinian creativity and continuity.

He believes The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it. So he has taken the initiative; left the coast; acquired his own shop in a small, growing city in the continent&#39;s remote interior and is selling sundries little more than this and that, really to the natives.

If this is so, then the problem of being receives a straightforward resolution: to be is to be in communion. So the fundamental science, indeed the science that needs to underwrite all other sciences, is a theory of communication. Within such a theory of communication the proper object of study becomes not isolated particles but the information that passes between entities. In Being as Communion philosopher and mathematician William Dembski provides a non-technical overview of his work on information. Dembski attempts to make good on the promise of John Wheeler, Paul Davies, and others that information is poised to replace matter as the primary stuff of reality. With profound implications for theology and metaphysics, Being as Communion develops a relational ontology that is at once congenial to science and open to teleology in nature. All those interested in the intersections of theology, philosophy and science should read this book.</p><p>A philosopher and mathematician, William A. Dembski is a senior fellow with Discovery Institute&#39;s Center for Science and Culture as well as a research scientist with the Evolutionary Informatics Lab. A cross-disciplinary scholar, he has published widely in the mathematics, engineering, philosophy, and theology literature, and is the author/editor of more than 20 books. Being as Communion ties together two decades of his research on the relation between teleology and information.&#39;This is a clear, fresh, stimulating, and provocative book. I enjoyed reading it, and recommend it to anyone who would like to think more deeply about information, evolution and creativity.&#39;Rupert Sheldrake, University of Cambridge, UK&#39;Being as Communion is a masterpiece. Dembski&#39;s treatment of information is deep, rich and staggeringly original, gathering together many different threads from theology, philosophy and science. In an intellectual world that prizes outrageous proposals, Dembski modestly seeks to turn the world upside down by making the case that information is more fundamental than matter or energy. He thereby illuminates the primacy of mind in the cosmos. This book is a fresh and significant threat to materialist imperialism.&#39;Mark Fitzmaurice, General Medical Practitioner, Sydney, Australia</p><h2>The Arabian Nights: Introduction by Wen-chin Ouyang (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics Series)</h2><p>The most famous of all story collections, <i>The Arabian Nights, </i>also known as <i>The Book of the Thousand and One Nights, </i>is beloved around the world. Composed of Persian, Arabic, Greek, Indian, and other sources that accumulated over hundreds of years, these fabulous stories-within-stories have long fired readers&#x2019; imaginations with an enchanted world of flying carpets, magic lamps, genies, demons, magicians and sorceresses, carnivorous giants, and bloodthirsty bandits.&nbsp; <br><br> Translation has played a key role in the formation of <i>The</i> <i>Arabian Nights</i> as we know it, making it far more prominent in the West than it has ever been in the Arab world. Westerners&#x2019; first discovery of some of the tales in the early eighteenth century sparked a feverish thirst for more, which led to compilations that freely adapted, reconfigured, and even added to the originals.

The aim of this book is to provide designers, teachers, students, and interested laypersons with a set of ideas that will enrich their conversation, their writing, and above all their thinking about architecture. Written in a conversational style, it introduces difficult concepts gradually, step by step. Architectural theorists and philosophers are mentioned in passing and their works are listed in the bibliography, but they are not the subject of the book. Architecture, rather than philosophy, is at the centre of the picture. The aim is to enable the reader to understand architecture in all its aspects, rather than to learn the names of particular theorists. The book is divided into eight chapters, each covering a particular aspect of architecture. Thinking about Architecture will be an invaluable standard introduction to architectural theory for architecture students, practising architects and interested general readers.</p><p>Colin Davies is Professor of Architectural Theory at London Metropolitan University and the author of several books, including High Tech Architecture, The Prefabricated Home and Key Houses of the Twentieth Century (Laurence King, 2006).

Tom is a lusty, high-spirited yet good-hearted soul, and after he is banished by his guardian for youthful misbehavior he heads to London to make his own fortune, with the smitten Sophia in pursuit. A series of bawdy escapades and assorted scrapes ensues, including a duel and a stint in prison, before the mystery of Tom&#x2019;s birth is unraveled. Fielding used all the dramatic skill he had amassed as a successful playwright for the London stage to tell this hugely entertaining story of a flawed but generous hero claiming his true identity and his true love. <br>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed).</p></p><p>Tom Jones isn&#39;t a bad guy, but boys just want to have fun.

This epic of everyday life chronicles the adventures of Tome Jones, who was abandoned as an infant and grows into a lusty, imprudent young man.

In this book, one of our preeminent scholars of American intellectual history examines how liberal Protestant thinkers struggled to embrace modernity, even at the cost of yielding much of the symbolic capital of Christianity to more conservative, evangelical communities of faith.</p><br><p> If religion is not simply a private concern, but a potential basis for public policy and a national culture, does this mean that religious ideas can be subject to the same kind of robust public debate normally given to ideas about race, gender, and the economy? Or is there something special about religious ideas that invites a suspension of critical discussion? These essays, collected here for the first time, demonstrate that the critical discussion of religious ideas has been central to the process by which Protestantism has been liberalized throughout the history of the United States, and shed light on the complex relationship between religion and politics in contemporary American life.</p><br><br><p> <i>After Cloven Tongues of Fire</i> brings together in one volume David Hollinger's most influential writings on ecumenical Protestantism. The book features an informative general introduction as well as concise introductions to each essay.</p></p><p><p>"Liberal Protestantism is not appreciated enough, not studied enough, and keeps getting written off as a movement destined to fade away. David Hollinger, one of our finest and most provocative intellectual historians, reminds us how important liberal Protestant ideas have been in advancing movements for social reform and in shaping our current self-understandings. And his account of the struggle of Christians with the Enlightenment is hugely instructive at a moment when all our faith traditions continue to confront the effects of the acids of modernity. In bringing together some of Hollinger's most important work, <i>After Cloven Tongues of Fire</i> is an exciting book that challenges many of the assumptions lurking behind our debates over religion's role in American public life."<b>--E. J. Dionne Jr., author of <i>Our Divided Political Heart</i> and <i>Souled Out</i></b></p><p>"This book by America's leading intellectual historian is essential reading for anyone who cares to understand the rise, decline, and enduring legacy of what was once our dominant religious tradition. David Hollinger's essays, always empathetic but never uncritical, treat the 'worldly' Protestants with the moral rigor they deserve."<b>--Michael Kazin, author of <i>American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation</i></b></p><p>"Hollinger's book will take its place as one of the most important works in modern American intellectual history published in recent decades. It shows this exemplary scholar practicing his craft at the highest level of scholarly excellence and deliberately and self-critically reflecting on his practice."<b>--James T. Kloppenberg, Harvard University</b></p><p>"A splendid book. Hollinger's trenchant, sweeping, and at times jolting essays pose critical questions about central issues in American religion, philosophy, and history with depth, insight, and understanding. <i>After Cloven Tongues of Fire</i> will attract a wide spectrum of readers."<b>--Jon Butler, Yale University</b></p><b>David A.

They are encouraged to look at oceanography as a cohesive and united discipline rather than a collection of subjects gathered under a marine umbrella. <i>Investigating Oceanography</i> teaches students about the historical, geological, physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the ocean environment using remarkable images and photos. The authors have incorporated essays written by several scientists discussing topics in their fields of specialization. In addition to understanding processes and principles, the authors believe students must have a basic command of the language of marine science in order to understand the constant barrage of information concerning our planet and marine issues. By the end of this course, the authors want students to be prepared for future environmental discussions and the ability to make decisions as informed global citizens.</p><p>Keith Sverdrup is a professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee.</p><h2>Bloody Tarawa: The 2d Marine Division, November 20-23, 1943</h2><p>On the morning of Saturday, November 20, 1943, the 2d Marine Division undertook the first modern amphibious assault against a well-defended beachhead. The objective was tiny Betio Island, Tarawa Atoll, and the going was supposed to be easy a target already ""pounded into coral dust"" by a massive naval and air bombardment. But what the Marines discovered was an island garrison alive and well, the Japanese defenses intact and manned by foes who would rather die than surrender. The battle that followed three full days of terror during which more than 3,000 died to ""secure"" an island half the size of New York&#x2019;s Central Park is fully told in words and pictures in this dramatic book. Building on the updated text of their 76 Hours: The Invasion of Tarawa, the authors use more than 250 photos and combat drawings from the U.S. Navy and Marine archives and private collections to reveal the graphic horror of warfare at its worst. Their book follows every terrifying step as the Marines, failed by the invasion&#x2019;s planners, are forced to wade more than 500 yards through fire-swept, knee-deep water, reaching land only to face what many historians agree was the best, most concentrated defenses American troops encountered in the entire Pacific War. The result is an immortal story of certainty shattered and courage recovered against overwhelming odds, of victory culled from near-defeat, and its terrible cost.</p><p>Eric Hammel is a critically acclaimed military historian and author of more than thirty combat and pictorial histories, including the extremely popular <i>Iwo Jima: Portrait of a Battle</i> (Zenith Press 2006).

A bit of medical gallows humor, this simile illustrates the difficulties of finding signals (the snowball) against a background of noise (the blizzard). Doctors are faced with similar difficulties every day when sifting through piles of data from blood tests to X-rays to endless lists of patient symptoms.<br><br>Diagnoses are often just educated guesses, and prognoses less certain still. There is a significant amount of uncertainty in the daily practice of medicine, resulting in confusion and potentially deadly complications. Dr. Steven Hatch argues that instead of ignoring this uncertainty, we should embrace it. By digging deeply into a number of rancorous controversies, from breast cancer screening to blood pressure management, Hatch shows us how medicine can fail-sometimes spectacularly-when patients and doctors alike place too much faith in modern medical technology. The key to good health might lie in the ability to recognize the hype created by so many medical reports, sense when to push a physician for more testing, or resist a physician's enthusiasm when unnecessary tests or treatments are being offered.<br><br>Both humbling and empowering, <i>Snowball in a Blizzard</i> lays bare the inescapable murkiness that permeates the theory and practice of modern medicine. Essential reading for physicians and patients alike, this book shows how, by recognizing rather than denying that uncertainty, we can all make better health decisions.<br></p><p><b>Steven Hatch</b> is an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, working in the Division of Infectious Disease and Immunology. He lives in Newton, Massachusetts."Uncertainty lies at the heart of modern medicine in ways that most physicians--not to mention their patients--often fail to recognize. Fundamental imperfections in our understanding of health and disease limit doctors' ability to combat illness. Hatch, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, argues that physicians who ignore this uncertainty often overtreat their patients, resulting in sometimes harmful, even fatal consequences. By the same token, far too many patients assume that more medical care is always better than less, thereby seeking or consenting to toxic treatments that trigger needless suffering. Hatch provides examples from such fields as breast cancer, cardiology and infectious disease. He also offers straightforward rules of thumb to help readers navigate medical advice."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Scientific American</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Informative...<i>Snowball in a Blizzard</i> adds an important perspective...[The book] rightly sounds the alarm: Better communication between doctors and patients is essential to improve medical decision making."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i></i></b><br><br>"A penetrating examination of uncertainty in diagnoses and treatment."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Nature </i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Snowball in a Blizzard</i> is Hatch's first book, but the clarity and wit of his discussions rank with that of the best science writers."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Shelf Awareness </i></b></i></b><br><br>"This intriguing perspective on the obscurity of medicine...is highly recommended for health-care professionals, health-conscious patients, and well-informed consumer health readers."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Library Journal</i>, starred review</b></i></b><br><br>"A carefully argued, unsettling, and important work."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In writing, Hatch strives to find 'that sweet spot where readability and scholarliness overlap'... he succeeds, telling stories that clarify the points he's making, and he even includes a highly personal anecdote that shows him struggling to deal with doctors who were sure they knew the right treatment for his elderly, hospitalized father... Hatch ably reveals the shortcomings of medicine."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i></b><br><br>"I can say with certainty that Steven Hatch's <i>Snowball</i> astutely deconstructs the uncertainty in the practice of medicine--from diagnosis to treatment to media coverage--as well as this important topic has ever been tackled."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Eric Topol, author of <i>The Patient Will See You Now</i></b></i></b><br><br>"What could be more intuitive: that physicians should be humble, admitting the uncertainty of their medical sciences and treating their patients like equals.

When assaulted by daily acts of violence and untimely death, what happens to trust? Set in the lands of Northeast Brazil, this is an account of the everyday experience of scarcity, sickness and death that centres on the lives of the women and children of a hillside &#34;favela&#34;. Bringing her readers to the impoverished slopes above the modern plantation town of Bom Jesus de Mata, where she has worked on and off for 25 years, Nancy Scheper-Hughes follows three generations of shantytown women as they struggle to survive through hard work, cunning and triage. It is a story of class relations told at the most basic level of bodies, emotions, desires and needs. Most disturbing - and controversial - is her finding that mother love, as conventionally understood, is something of a bourgeois myth, a luxury for those who can reasonably expect, as these women cannot, that their infants will live.</p><p>Nancy Scheper-Hughes&nbsp;is Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her book&nbsp;<i>Saints, Scholars, and Schizophrenics: Mental Illness in Rural Ireland</i>&nbsp;(California, 1979) received the Margaret Mead Award in 1981. She is the winner of the 2000 J. I. Stanley Prize of the School of American Research.A shattering portrayal of life among the impoverished inhabitants of Alto do Cruzeiro (``Hill of the Crucifixion''), a shantytown in the city of Bom Jesus da Mata in northeastern Brazil's Pernambuco Province. Scheper-Hughes (Anthropology/UC at Berkeley), whose 1979 Saints, Scholars, and Schizophrenics (not reviewed) won the Margaret Mead Award, has again produced a work of enormous power and importance. Alto do Cruzeiro is well named: Life in its fetid alleyways and smoke-filled mud-and-sheet-metal huts is a perpetual Golgotha where poverty, malnutrition, and terrorism make death and ``disappearances'' commonplace--and where, in 1987, the infant and child mortality rate reached more than 23 percent of total births. Scheper-Hughes, who first came to the area as a Peace Corps volunteer in the mid-1960's and who has returned again and again, focuses most of her attention on the women of the Alto. Bringing an unusual sensitivity to her research and couching her findings in prose that is at once subtle and precise, she urges ``a more `womanly' anthropology,'' one that engages ``questions of human relationships and ethics.'' The author explores the social, economic, political, and religious factors--the plantation system's exploitation of the workers; governmental corruption and indifference; superstition; the hidebound conservatism of the Roman Catholic hierarchy--that contribute to the inhumane conditions. In what is undoubtedly her most controversial conclusion, Scheper- Hughes contends that the uncertainty of existence within the ghetto community atrophies impoverished women's feelings of what is thought in more stable Western societies to be an inherent female trait--``mother love.'' The author makes a strong case for this finding, which undoubtedly will provoke heated discussion. A stimulating, consistently engrossing contribution to the scientific understanding of a complex and tragic situation.

Lying in the shadow of the colonization of northern Algeria, which claimed the lives of over a million people, French empire in the Sahara sought power through physical force as it had elsewhere; yet violence in the Algerian Sahara followed a more complicated logic than the old argument that it was simply a way to get empire on the cheap<b>. </b><br><b></b><br><b></b><i>A Desert Named Peace </i>examines colonial violence through multiple stories and across several fields of research.

The first two essays deal with the modern European philosophical and scientific tradition, notably the ogy of Edmund Husserl. The next four essays concern the crucial notion of observation as defined by Luhmann. They examine the history of paradox as a logical problem and as a historically conditioned feature of rhetoric; deconstruct the thinking of Jacques Derrida, especially his language-centered allegiances; discuss the usefulness of Spencer Brown's <i>Laws of Form</i>; and assess the consequences of observation and paradox for epistemology. The following essays present Luhmann's theory of communication and his articulation of the difference between thought and communication, a difference that makes clear one of Luhmann's most radical and controversial theses, that the individual not only does not form the basic element of society but is excluded from it altogether, situated instead in the environment of the social system. The book concludes with a polemic against the critical thought of the Frankfurt School of postwar German social thought.</p><p>&#x201c;Luhmann&#x2019;s thought has become more and more influential internationally as one of the very rare examples of the ability of social theory to enlarge its theoretical resources and thereby gain a new grasp of significant empirical phenomena.

The officers and men of the Confederate Navy were defeated at every turn by a national policy and a local tangle of political, economic, and social issues. Southern officers resigned their Union Navy commissions to fight for principle -- and soon found themselves enmeshed in construction schedules and bureaucratic delays. All too often, naval officers on both sides found themselves engaged in what is now termed &#34;modern warfare&#34;. In this story of the Civil War, the phrase &#34;arms and the man&#34; begins to take on the contemporary ring of man and machine and man within and against the system.</p><p></p><h2>Best and Taylor&#39;s Physiological Basis of Medical Practice</h2><p>A classic text of medical physiology for clinicians as well as for students...the sections on gastrointestinal physiology, blood, and neurophysiology have been extensively revised and all other sections thoroughly updated.</p><p></p><h2>Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat Responding to the Challenge</h2><p>The greatest danger facing the world today, says Alan M. Dershowitz, comes from religiously inspired, state sponsored terrorist groups that seek to develop weapons of mass destruction for use against civilian targets. In his newest book, Dershowitz argues passionately and persuasively that global terrorism is a phenomenon largely of our own making and that we must and can take steps to reduce the frequency and severity of terrorist acts.<br>Analyzing recent acts of terrorism and our reaction to them, Dershowitz explains that terrorism is successful when the international community gives in to the demands of terrorists?or even tries to understand and eliminate the ?root causes&#x201d; of terrorism. He discusses extreme approaches to wiping out international terrorism that would work if we were not constrained by legal, moral, and humanitarian considerations. And then, given that we do operate under such constraints, he offers a series of proposals that would effectively reduce the frequency and severity of international terrorism by striking a balance between security and liberty.</p><p>&#34;Perhaps America&#39;s most brilliant public intellectual, Alan Dershowitz attacks the central challenge of our times-terrorism-with ruthless honesty and striking originality, delivered in a narrative so compelling that the pages seem to turn themselves.&#34;-Richard North Patterson, author of Protect and Defend; &#34;Critical reading for anyone interested in the legacy terrorism has left us, how our previous weak responses have encouraged more of it, and how we can end it.&#34;-William J.

Not just fancy but Fancy: an early nineteenth-century cultural phenomenon born out of new and enlightened ways of seeing, understanding, and responding to the surrounding world. Fancy expressed itself in just about everything that pleased the senses; generally colorful and boldly patterned, it elicited delight, awe, surprise, whim, and caprice. Whether experienced in the form of painted surfaces, kaleidoscopic quilts, or imaginary landscapes, Fancy engaged the emotions and expanded the imagination, expressing the core of human fancy. <i>American Fancy</i> offers an appropriately fantastic experience of this uniquely American sensibility. Author Sumpter Priddy has assembled and produced an original oeuvre in the field of decorative arts, going beyond the traditional modes of furniture analysis, which concentrate on style, history, and construction, to consider the perceptual and emotional responses through which the original users and viewers would have interacted with these material things. To this end he employs the interpretive methods used in the fields of literature, fine arts, philosophy and even psychology. Rich, fully illustrated, wondrously researched, and bound in a cover that imitates a typical Fancy pattern, <i>American Fancy</i> does its marvelous subject true.</p><p></p><h2>Tears of the Oracle (New Adventures)</h2><p>The ancient remains of the Oracles of the Lost have been found on an obscure planetoid called KS-159.

So it was fitting that Pontiac made the last legitimate muscle cars of era: the 1973 and 1974 Trans Am Super Duty 455. As a second-gen F-Body car, the Trans Am featured refined styling, handling, and ride, but still retained brutish power. However, because of rising gas prices and insurance costs, these cars were not produced in great numbers, so they are extremely rare and valuable today.<p>In Volume No. 6 of CarTech's In Detail series, author Barry Kluczyk goes behind the scenes to reveal how a cadre of dedicated personnel at Pontiac refused to relinquish high-performance, forged ahead, and built the last great muscle car, the 1973 and 1974 Trans Am Super Duty 455. He retraces the design, development, and manufacture of each major component of the group. He also covers engine development and special equipment of the Super Duty 455 engine. In addition, covered are the high-performance chassis and suspension parts, so the TA could effectively apply and control all of the power.</p><p>All In Detail Series books include an introduction and historical overview, an explanation of the design and concepts involved in creating the car, a look at marketing and promotion, and an in-depth study of all hardware and available options, as well as an examination of where the car is on the market today.

The book features up-to-date network technology, including practical treatment of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).</p><p>Suitable for students, working network engineers, and (to some degree) salespeople responsible for promoting network services, <i>An Engineering Approach to Computer Networking: ATM Networks, the Internet, and the Telephone Network</i> explains how voice and data networks operate. Author Srinivsan Keshav does a great job of explaining how various systems--especially Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, and switched voice networks--communicate signals from one point to another. He notes similarities and differences among the systems' approaches to the problem of telecommunications and highlights the challenges inherent in integrating them. If you're involved in building a large network, particularly if you'll be laying your own cable over long distances--you'll appreciate the design advice this book provides. <p> <i>An Engineering Approach to Computer Networking</i> takes an academic approach to its topic--the author based this book on lectures he gave at several universities, after all. You can fault his writing style for its dryness, but not for lack of detail or breadth of coverage. He deserves particular praise for his explanation of the seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, complete with an intelligent analogy between a letter delivered by a postal service and a packet traveling over a network. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Fundamentals of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6), and telephone networks. Multiplexing, collision management, queuing, switching and routing under ATM, IP, and switched voice.</p><p> The world is surging toward a digital revolution where computer networks mediate every aspect of modern life, from paying bills to buying real estate, and from reading a book to watching a film. Computer networks are complex systems that almost magically link tens of millions of computers and more than a billion telephones around the world. A single mouse-click in a Web browser can download text, images, and animations from a computer hundreds or thousands of miles away. With a satellite or cellular telephone, even the most intrepid explorer in the remotest corner of the Earth can call home. How do we build these marvelous webs of interconnection? The goal of this book is to introduce readers to what lies at the basis of computer networks, and why they work the way they do. This book is based on a course that I taught at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India, in the spring of 1993. My aim was to teach students why networks were built the way they were. I wanted them to question every design decision, and to understand how these decisions would change if we changed the assumptions. I call this an engineering approach to computer networking.</p><p></p><p> Perhaps it is easiest to appreciate this approach by comparing it with some other approaches. Suppose you wanted to route packets in a computer network. A protocol approach would describe the routing protocols in common use and their packet formats and algorithms, and perhaps compare several routing protocols. An analytical approach would model the network as a graph, assume a traffic distribution from every source to every destination, then compute optimal routing. In my opinion, both these approaches, though important, miss the point. A purely protocol approach tells the reader how routing works, but not why it was designed that way. The success of an analytical approach depends critically on the assumptions it makes. Unfortunately, because of the complexities of the real world, to make the problem tractable, the analyst must make many simplifying assumptions. In my experience, this simplification leads to "toy" models that do not explain what is really important, and what details we can ignore. In contrast, the engineering approach is to begin by identifying the fundamental constraints on the problem, make reasonable "real-world" assumptions, and then examine several alternative solutions, trading off their pros and cons. An engineer recognizes that no solution is perfect, but that every solution represents a particular trade-off between cost and benefit. This book focuses on identifying the fundamental problems and the trade-offs in solving them.</p><p></p><p> The second aspect of an engineering approach is to learn by doing. This book is meant to be used with implementation exercises on the Internet and on the REAL network simulator. These exercises, which are available on-line at aw/cp/keshav/engcom.html, allow students to learn protocol design and implementation hands-on. Unlike other textbooks in the area, this book simultaneously studies the principles underlying the Internet, the telephone network, and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. The Internet is the most successful embodiment of a data network, and its study needs no further justification. The global telephone network is arguably the world's largest computer network, though it is specialized to carry voice. Unfortunately, few outside the telephone industry know much about how the telephone network operates, perhaps because of the layers of acronyms and arcana that surround its operations. This book is a small attempt to rectify the situation. Finally, many see ATM networks as the future of computer networking. Although this may not be true, ATM networks are interesting because they draw on experience with the telephone network and the Internet to build an integrated services network that provides end-to-end quality of service. This ambitious goal has led to a unique set of design decisions that have influenced both networking research and commercial networking products. Thus, ATM networks are well worth studying.</p><p>Target audience</p><p></p><p> I assume that readers will have some familiarity with data structures and algorithms, operating systems, elementary algebra, and computer architecture. Deeper material assumes knowledge of calculus and probability. However, most concepts do not require mathematical sophistication beyond a first undergraduate course. In particular, the book almost completely avoids use of queuing theory. Although an appreciation of queuing theory is important in engineering computer networks, I feel queuing theory is best studied as a separate course: to really understand its strengths and its domain of applicability, one needs a deep understanding of the topic that cannot be provided by a book such as this.</p><p></p><p> The bulk of this book is written at a level suitable for first-year graduate students in computer science or electrical engineering. It is also suitable for advanced undergraduate seniors. Students who intend to work in the area of computer networking or related areas should probably read through the entire text and attempt all the exercises. A number of features make it easy to use for a first undergraduate course. First, every chapter is self-contained, so that instructors can skip entire chapters if necessary. Second, each topic is developed from first principles, with little assumption about the background of the reader, other than some familiarity with mathematics and operating systems. A more sophisticated development that follows from these first principles is marked with vertical sidebars and can be ignored in a first course. Third, most topics are presented at an intuitive level, with little mathematical or algorithmic formalism. Finally, complete solutions are provided to instructors for all numerical exercises.</p><p></p><p> The book is also targeted at professionals in the field, and at researchers in other areas who want an introduction to the current research frontiers in computer networking. A comprehensive index helps in locating a topic quickly. Moreover, the glossary is keyed to the section or subsection that describes the topic, so that one can rapidly look up the context for a technical term. For those interested in pursuing a topic further, an extensive annotated bibliography references key papers in the field.</p><p>Organization</p><p></p><p> The book has three sections. The first section is an overview of three important networking technologies: telephony (Chapter 2), Internet (Chapter 3), and ATM (Chapter 4). Each introductory chapter describes key elements in the technology, some history, and my perception of the important challenges for the technology.</p><p></p><p> The second section describes the pieces that come together to form a network. Most chapters in this section begin with an overview of a problem and a taxonomy of possible solutions. We then study a number of representative solutions, concentrating on the set of trade-offs they represent. We can apply most of these solutions to any protocol layer, so we study them independently of protocol layering.</p><p></p><p> The second section starts with an introductory chapter on protocol layering (Chapter 5) and an overview of the art and science of system design (Chapter 6). These chapters provide a "toolkit" of common system design techniques that we will use in subsequent chapters. Chapter 7 introduces the issue of multiple access, which arises in contexts as diverse as satellite networks, cellular telephony, and local area networks. Chapter 8 describes switching, which is fundamental to the operation of all nontrivial networks. In order to provide end-to-end quality of service, switches (and other multiplexing points) must implement a scheduling algorithm. We study scheduling algorithms in Chapter 9. The next two chapters cover naming, addressing, and routing. At this point, the reader knows enough about how to put together a wide-area network. But, for the network to work efficiently, we need to add two more functionalities: error control and flow control. We study these in Chapters 12 and 13. As we build larger and larger networks, the problem of network control becomes significant. We study this in Chapter 14.</p><p></p><p> The third section applies the tools and techniques discussed in the preceding chapters to understanding and implementing some common protocols. Chapter 15 presents a detailed description of protocol headers in the telephone network, Internet, and ATM networks, tying together the material in the previous chapters. Finally, Chapter 16 is a survey of protocol implementation techniques.</p><p>Style conventions</p><p></p><p> Textbooks, almost by definition, tend to be boring. A dry assemblage of facts does little to bring out the controversies, the intellectual fights, and the wide-eyed what-if questions that make networking such an interesting and challenging field. I have attempted to capture some of these in what I call engineering boxes. These boxes go off on a tangent from the text, question standard assumptions, and present viewpoints on the fringe of the mainstream. They offer a subjective commentary on the objective and dry material in the text.</p><p></p><p> I firmly believe in the use of numerical examples to explain concepts. Solved numerical examples throughout the book reinforce the use of back-of-the-envelope calculations in system design, and simultaneously introduce the student to "real-world" constants that engineers use in their calculations. I hope these examples will motivate readers to do their own rough calculations as they embark on a system design.</p><p></p><p> Advanced material is in smaller font and set off with vertical sidebars as shown in this paragraph. Such material can be ignored in a first reading, or in an undergradute course, with no loss of continuity.</p><p>Usage guidelines</p><p></p><p> In a graduate class, I recommend that the instructor assign Chapters 1-5 as a single reading assignment at the end of the first class. The material here should serve primarily as a review. Subsequent chapters, starting with Chapter 6, can be covered in two or three one-hour lectures per chapter, except Chapter 11, which will require four lectures. In my courses, I used the first hour to cover principles, and the second (and, if necessary, third) to cover specific solutions. I also recommend choosing some exercises for homework and assigning one implementation exercise every two weeks.</p><p></p><p> In an undergraduate class, the instructor could spend the first several lectures on the first six chapters. The remaining chapters could be covered at the discretion of the instructor, perhaps skipping advanced material. In a first course, Chapters 13, 14, and 16 and advanced topics in Chapters 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 can be left out entirely.</p><p></p><p> A reader unfamiliar with the field should probably first read Chapters 1-4. Subseqent chapters may be read as the occasion arises. Much of the material can also be accessed by way of the keyed glossary.</p><p>Acknowledgments</p><p></p><p> I have drawn upon many people in the course of writing this book.

If so, how has the information clothes convey changed over the years? Using a wide range of historical and contemporary materials, Diana Crane demonstrates how the social significance of clothing has been transformed.<br> <br> Crane compares nineteenth-century societies&#x2014;France and the United States&#x2014;where social class was the most salient aspect of social identity signified in clothing with late twentieth-century America, where lifestyle, gender, sexual orientation, age, and ethnicity are more meaningful to individuals in constructing their wardrobes. Today, clothes worn at work signify social class, but leisure clothes convey meanings ranging from trite to political. In today's multicode societies, clothes inhibit as well as facilitate communication between highly fragmented social groups.<br> <br> Crane extends her comparison by showing how nineteenth-century French designers created fashions that suited lifestyles of Paris elites but that were also widely adopted outside France. By contrast, today's designers operate in a global marketplace, shaped by television, film, and popular music. No longer confined to elites, trendsetters are drawn from many social groups, and most trends have short trajectories. To assess the impact of fashion on women, Crane uses voices of college-aged and middle-aged women who took part in focus groups. These discussions yield fascinating information about women's perceptions of female identity and sexuality in the fashion industry.<br> <br> An absorbing work, <i>Fashion and Its Social Agendas</i> stands out as a critical study of gender, fashion, and consumer culture.<br> "Why do people dress the way they do? How does clothing contribute to a person's identity as a man or woman, as a white-collar professional or blue-collar worker, as a preppie, yuppie, or nerd? How is it that dress no longer denotes social class so much as lifestyle? . . . Intelligent and informative, [this] book proposes thoughtful answers to some of these questions."-<i>Library Journal</i></p></p><p>What are you wearing-and what does it <i>mean</i>? In this absorbing book, Diana Crane explores the social significance of clothing-from denoting class in the 19th century to ethnicity, sexual orientation, or political beliefs in the 20th-and assesses both the role of fashion in creating identity and the roles of media and consumerism in creating fashion itself.<b>Diana Crane</b> is a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Mathematics of the Transcendental: Onto-logy and being-there</h2><p><p>In Mathematics of the Transcendental, Alain Badiou painstakingly works through the pertinent aspects of Category Theory, demonstrating their internal logic and veracity, their derivation and distinction from Set Theory, and the 'thinking of being'. In doing so he sets out the basic onto-logical requirements of his greater and transcendental logics as articulated in his magnum opus, Logics of Worlds. This important book combines both his elaboration of the disjunctive synthesis between ontology and onto-logy (the discourses of being as such and being-appearing) from the perspective of Category Theory and the categorial basis of his philosophical conception of 'being there'.</p><p>Hitherto unpublished in either French or English, Mathematics of the Transcendental provides Badiou's readers with a much-needed complete elaboration of his understanding and use of Category Theory. The book is an essential aid to understanding the mathematical and logical basis of his theory of appearing as elaborated in Logics of Worlds and other works and is essential reading for his many followers.</p></p><p>Alain Badiou, one of the world&#39;s most celebrated contemporary philosophers, provides readers with a complete elaboration of his understanding and use of Category Theory.<p>Alex Ling is Research Lecturer in Communication and Media Studies at the University of Western Sydney, Australia.</p></p><h2>The Anaesthetics of Architecture (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>In this short, intentionally polemical book, Neil Leach draws on theideas of philosophers and cultural theorists such as Walter Benjaminand Jean Baudrillard to develop a novel and highly incisive critiqueof the consequences of the growing preoccupation with images andimage-making in contemporary architectural culture.</b></p><p>In this short, intentionally polemical book, Neil Leach draws on the ideas of philosophers and cultural theorists such as Walter Benjamin and Jean Baudrillard to develop a novel and highly incisive critique of the consequences of the growing preoccupation with images and image-making in contemporary architectural culture. The problem with this preoccupation, Leach argues, is that it can induce a sort of numbness, as the saturation of images floods the senses and obscures deeper concerns. This problem is particularly acute for a discipline such as architecture, which relies heavily on visual representation. As a result, architects can become anaesthetized from the social and political realities of everyday life. In the intoxicating world of the image, the aesthetics of architecture threaten to become the anaesthetics of architecture. In this culture of aesthetic consumption, this "culture of the cocktail," meaningful discourse gives way to strategies of seduction, and architectural design is reduced to the superficial play of empty, seductive forms.</p></p><p>Neil Leach is an architect and theorist who has taught at a number of institutions worldwide, including the Architectural Association in London, the Dessau Institute Dessau, Germany, and Columbia University. He is the author, editor, or translator of more than a dozen books, including <i>Rethinking Architecture</i>, <i>The Anaesthetics of Architecture</i> (MIT Press, 1999), and Alberti's <i>On the Art of Building in Ten Books</i> (MIT Press 1991).More like expanded essays than exhaustive studies, these brief pieces are take radically different approaches to the perception and experience of buildings. Hildebrand (architecture/art history, Univ. of Washington), author of The Wright Space: Pattern and Meaning in Frank Lloyd Wright's Houses (Univ. of Washington, 1991), applies his considerable descriptive skills to examples from the history of architecture before and after the domestic work of Wright. Examining the spatial rhythms of his selections with evident pleasure and helpful clarity, Hildebrand applies the intriguing classifications of refuge and prospectAromantic enclosure vs. classical opennessAto describe interior space. More illustrations would help concretize the original and important observations here. To the degree that Hildebrand's volume explores the materiality of his examples, Leach (architecture, Univ. of Nottingham) focuses on the abstract and philosophical implications of his choices. The editor of Rethinking Architecture: A Reader in Cultural Theory (Routledge, 1997), Leach discusses the sometimes difficult theories of Walter Benjamin, Jean Baudrillard, and Guy Debord, among others, to make the point that the architectural preference for imagemaking, along with the sensory overload of our society, devalues, or anaesthetizes, our experience of their work. Leach expresses sharp indignation toward theories of post-Modernism; the writings of Robert Venturi, Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour; and the tendency in the style to dissociate form from content, though the offense he takes at a recruiting advertisement by the London firm of T.P. Bennett Associates seems insufficiently explained and remains puzzling. General academic collections will benefit from the addition of Hildebrand's study, while only highly specialized collections will require Leach's as well.APaul Glassman, New York Sch. of Interior Design Lib. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The World in Guangzhou: Africans and Other Foreigners in South China&#39;s Global Marketplace</h2><p>Only decades ago, the population of Guangzhou was almost wholly Chinese. Today, it is a truly global city, a place where people from around the world go to make new lives, find themselves, or further their careers. A large number of these migrants are small-scale traders from Africa who deal in Chinese goods&#x2014;often knockoffs or copies of high-end branded items&#x2014;to send back to their home countries. In <i>The World in Guangzhou</i>, Gordon Mathews explores the question of how the city became a center of &#x201c;low-end globalization&#x201d; and shows what we can learn from that experience about similar transformations elsewhere in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Through detailed ethnographic portraits, Mathews reveals a world of globalization based on informality, reputation, and trust rather than on formal contracts. How, he asks, can such informal relationships emerge between two groups&#x2014;Chinese and sub-Saharan Africans&#x2014;that don't share a common language, culture, or religion? And what happens when Africans move beyond their status as temporary residents and begin to put down roots and establish families?<br> &nbsp;<br> Full of unforgettable characters, <i>The World in Guangzhou</i> presents a compelling account of globalization at ground level and offers a look into the future of urban life as transnational connections continue to remake cities around the world.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Gordon Mathews</b> is professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. <b>Linessa Dan Lin</b> is a PhD candidate in the Anthropology Department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. <b>Yang Yang</b> graduated with a master of philosophy in anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Compelling stories of corruption and cutthroat competition at the heart of low end globalization in Guangzhou make this the perfect sequel to Mathews&#x2019; <i>Ghetto at the Center of the World</i>. <i>The World in Guangzhou</i> is filled with riveting and disturbing tales of racial others, migrants&#x2019; dreams of getting rich, and relationships between foreigners&#x2014;mostly African traders and entrepreneurs&#x2014;and local Chinese.&#x201d; (<i>Nicole Constable, University of Pittsburgh</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;I continue to be impressed by Mathews&#x2019;s combination of a long, skillful buildup of local knowledge with a great sense of how to communicate with a wide readership.

Along the way he also sheds considerable light on such closely related issues as realism and idealism, absolutism and relativism, and the nature of contemporary pragmatism.At a time when it is fashionable for scholars outside of philosophy to deny the possibility of truth, Schmitt's lucid, technically accurate survey offers the easiest way to understand what is really at stake in such denials. <i>Truth: A Primer</i> is a quick but accurate and philosophically sophisticated overview that will prove invaluable to philosophers and their students in a wide range of courses, in particular epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of language.</p><p></p><h2>Irrationality: The Enemy within</h2><p>Why do doctors, army generals, high-ranking government officials and other people in positions of power make bad decisions that cause harm to others?

Taking into account that Whitman did much of the typesetting for the first edition himself, the editors of this reproduction, paid special attention not only to text itself but also to an authentic reproduction of pagination, paragraphing and linebreaks. <br><br> <em>LEAVES</em> OF GRASS is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819-1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent most of his professional life writing and re-writing LEAVES OF GRASS, revising it multiple times until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades-the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.<br><br> LEAVES OF GRASS has its genesis in an essay called The Poet by Ralph Waldo Emerson, published in 1844, which expressed the need for the United States to have its own new and unique poet to write about the new country's virtues and vices. Whitman, reading the essay, consciously set out to answer Emerson's call as he began work on the first edition of LEAVES OF GRASS. Whitman, however, downplayed Emerson's influence, stating, "I was simmering, simmering, simmering; Emerson brought me to a boil."<br><br> On May 15, 1855, Whitman registered the title LEAVES OF GRASS with the clerk of the United States District Court, Southern District of New Jersey, and received its copyright. The first edition was published in Brooklyn at the printing shop of two Scottish immigrants, James and Andrew Rome, whom Whitman had known since the 1840s, on July 4, 1855. Whitman paid for and did much of the typesetting for the first edition himself. The book did not include the author's name, instead offering an engraving by Samuel Hollyer depicting Whitman in work clothes and a jaunty hat, arms at his side. Early advertisements for the first edition appealed to "lovers of literary curiosities" as an oddity. Sales on the book were few but Whitman was not discouraged.<br><br> The poems of LEAVES OF GRASS are loosely connected and each represents Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, LEAVES OF GRASS (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.</p><p>Walt Whitman was an American poet and writer born in New York in 1819. Despite his family s financial troubles, Whitman attended school and, after graduating at age eleven, worked in a lawyer s office before becoming a printer s apprentice. Before he had even turned sixteen Whitman began anonymously publishing his poetry at the Long Island Star, where he worked. After leaving the Star, Whitman moved through several jobs including teaching, publishing and typesetting. Eventually, though, Whitman determined to make his living writing poetry, and paid for the first publication of Leaves of Grass himself when he was thirty-seven. At the time of its publication, Leaves of Grass was met with controversy and was criticized for its overtly sexual themes, however, but it has since come to be one of the most important works in early American literature and a product of the transcendentalist movement. Whitman died in 1892 at the age of seventy-two.</p><h2>Advanced Cobol</h2><p><p>The best reference for any COBOL-85/COBOL-II professional in industry.</p> <p><b>Contents:</b><br> * Program Structure<br> * Structured Programming<br> * Environment Division<br> * Exercises<br> * Data Definition<br> * Exercises<br> * Procedure Division Statements<br> * Arithmetic Precision<br> * Data Transfer<br> * Character Processing<br> * Exercises<br> * Table Handling<br> * Sequential Files<br> * Sorting and Merging<br> * Indexed Files<br> * Relative File Processing<br> * Subprograms and Nested Programs<br> * Report Generation<br> * Interactive Processing<br> * Data Structures<br> * Program Cohesion<br> * Program Design<br> * Program Testing<br> * A Review<br> * Appendix B COBOL Reserved Words<br> * Index</p></p><p></p><h2>Management &amp; Organisational Behaviour</h2><p>Written in an engaging style and packed with contemporary references to management research and practice, Management and Organisational Behaviour provides you with: frequent questions and exorcises to enable you to think critically about issues of practical relevance and academic debate; activities and assignments to develop your personal and professional skills for work and study; case studies featuring organisations from Apple to Zara to illustrate such important issues as organisational culture and diversity, social enterprise, personal and corporate responsibility; exclusive access to online resources which reinforce your knowledge and assess your understanding; and the knowledge and support you need to succeed in your studies, research your project work and pass your exams.</p><p></p><h2>The Story of Valentine&#39;s Day</h2><p>In only 200 words, author Skarmeas tells the story of how Valentine&#39;s Day came into being.

His reacquaintance with Venice, a city he loved, provided the inspiration for Across the River and into the Trees, the story of Richard Cantwell, a war-ravaged American colonel stationed in Italy at the close of the Second World War, and his love for a young Italian countess. A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, Across the River and into the Trees stands as Hemingway&#x2019;s statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War. Hemingway&#x2019;s last full-length novel published in his lifetime, it moved John O&#x2019;Hara in The New York Times Book Review to call him &#x2018;the most important author since Shakespeare.&#x2019;</p><p>Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>&nbsp;immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>They started two hours before daylight, and at first, it was not necessary to break the ice across the canal as other boats had gone on ahead.

The shooter sat on a shooting stool fastened to the top of a box that contained his lunch and shells, and the shooter's two, or more, guns were propped against the load of wooden decoys. Somewhere, in each boat, there was a sack with one or two live mallard hens, or a hen and a drake, and in each boat there was a dog who shifted and shivered uneasily at the sound of the wings of the ducks that passed overhead in the darkness.<br><br>Four of the boats went on up the main canal toward the big lagoon to the north. A fifth boat had already turned off into a side canal. Now, the sixth boat turned south into a shallow lagoon, and there was no broken water.<br><br>It was all ice, new-frozen during the sudden, windless cold of the night. It was rubbery and bending against the thrust of the boatman's oar. Then it would break as sharply as a pane of glass, but the boat made little forward progress.<br><br>"Give me an oar," the shooter in the sixth boat said. He stood up and braced himself carefully. He could hear the ducks passing in the darkness, and feel the restless lurching of the dog. To the north he heard the sound of breaking ice from the other boats.<br><br>"Be careful," the poler in the stern said. "Don't tip the boat over."<br><br>"I am a boatman, too," the shooter said.<br><br>He took the long oar the boatman handed him and reversed it so he could hold it by the blade. Holding the blade he reached forward and punched the handle through the ice. He felt the firm bottom of the shallow lagoon, put his weight on the top of the wide oar-blade, and holding with both hands and, first pulling, then shoving, until the pole-hold was well to the stern, he drove the boat ahead to break the ice. The ice broke like sheets of plate glass as the boat drove into it, and onto it, and astern the boatman shoved them ahead into the broken passage.<br><br>After a while, the shooter, who was working hard and steadily and sweating in his heavy clothes, asked the boatman, "Where is the shooting barrel?"<br><br>"Off there to the left. In the middle of the next bay."<br><br>"Should I turn for it now?"<br><br>"As you wish."<br><br>"What do you mean, as I wish? You know the water. Is there water to carry us there?"<br><br>"The tide is low. Who knows?"<br><br>"It will be daylight before we get there if we don't hurry."<br><br>The boatman did not answer.<br><br>All right, you surly jerk, the shooter thought to himself. We are going to get there. We've made two-thirds of the way now and if you are worried about having to work to break ice to pick up birds, that is altogether too bad.<br><br>"Get your back in it, jerk," he said in English.<br><br>"What?" the boatman asked in Italian.<br><br>"I said let's go. It's going to be light."<br><br>It was daylight before they reached the oaken staved hogshead sunk in the bottom of the lagoon. It was surrounded by a sloping rim of earth that had been planted with sedge and grass, and the shooter swung carefully up onto this, feeling the frozen grasses break as he stepped on them. The boatman lifted the combination shooting stool and shell box out of the boat and handed it to the shooter, who leaned over and placed it in the bottom of the big barrel.<br><br>The shooter, wearing his hip boots and an old combat jacket, with a patch on the left shoulder that no one understood, and with the slight light places on the straps, where stars had been removed, climbed down into the barrel and the boatman handed him his two guns.<br><br>He placed them against the wall of the barrel and hung his other shell bag between them, hanging it on two hooks built into the wall of the sunken barrel. Then he leaned the guns against each side of the shell bag.<br><br>"Is there water?" he asked the boatman.<br><br>"No water," the boatman said.<br><br>"Can you drink the lagoon water?"<br><br>"No. It is unhealthy."<br><br>The shooter was thirsty from the hard work of breaking the ice and driving the boat in and he felt his anger rise, and then held it, and said, "Can I help you in the boat to break ice to put out the decoys?"<br><br>"No," the boatman said and shoved the boat savagely out onto the thin sheet ice that cracked and ripped as the boat drove up onto it. The boatman commenced smashing at the ice with the blade of his oar and then started tossing decoys out to the side and behind him.<br><br>He's in a beautiful mood, the shooter thought. He's a big brute, too. I worked like a horse coming out here. He just pulled his weight and that's all. What the hell is eating him? This is his trade isn't it?<br><br>He arranged the shooting stool so he would have the maximum swing to left and right, opened a box of shells, and filled his pockets and opened another of the boxes of shells in the shell bag so he could reach into it easily. In front of him, where the lagoon lay glazed in the first light, was the black boat and the tall, heavily built boatman smashing with his oar at the ice and tossing decoys overboard as though he were ridding himself of something obscene.<br><br>It was getting lighter now and the shooter could see the low line of the near point across the lagoon. Beyond that point he knew there were two other shooting posts and far beyond it there was more marsh and then the open sea. He loaded both his guns and checked the position of the boat that was putting out decoys.<br><br>From behind him, he heard the incoming whisper of wings and he crouched, took hold of his right hand gun with his right hand as he looked up from under the rim of the barrel, then stood to shoot at the two ducks that were dropping down, their wings set to brake, coming down dark in the gray dim sky, slanting toward the decoys.<br><br>His head low, he swung the gun on a long slant, down, well and ahead of the second duck, then without looking at the result of his shot he raised the gun smoothly, up, up ahead and to the left of the other duck that was climbing to the left and as he pulled, saw it fold in flight and drop among the decoys in the broken ice. He looked to his right and saw the first duck a black patch on the same ice. He knew he had shot carefully on the first duck, far to the right of where the boat was, and on the second, high out and to the left, letting the duck climb far up and to the left to be sure the boat was out of any line of fire. It was a lovely double, shot exactly as he should have shot, with complete consideration and respect for the position of the boat, and he felt very good as he reloaded.<br><br>"Listen," the man in the boat called. "Don't shoot toward the boat."<br><br>I'll be a sad son of a bitch, the shooter said to himself. I will indeed.<br><br>"Get your decoys out," he called to the man in the boat. "But get them out fast. I won't shoot until they are all out. Except straight overhead."<br><br>The man in the boat said nothing that could be heard.<br><br>I can't figure it, the shooter thought to himself. He knows the game. He knows I split the work, or more, coming out. I never shot a safer or more careful duck in my life than that. What's the matter with him? I offered to put the dekes out with him. The hell with him.<br><br>Out on the right now, the boatman was still chopping angrily at the ice, and tossing out the wooden decoys in a hatred that showed in every move he made.<br><br>Don't let him spoil it, the shooter told himself. There won't be much shooting with this ice unless the sun should melt it later on. You probably will only have a few birds, so don't let him spoil it for you. You don't know how many more times you will shoot ducks and do not let anything spoil it for you.<br><br>He watched the sky lightening beyond the long point of marsh, and turning in the sunken barrel, he looked out across the frozen lagoon, and the marsh, and saw the snow-covered mountains a long way off. Low as he was, no foothills showed, and the mountains rose abruptly from the plain. As he looked toward the mountains he could feel a breeze on his face and he knew, then, the wind would come from there, rising with the sun, and that some birds would surely come flying in from the sea when the wind disturbed them.<br><br>The boatman had finished putting out the decoys. They were in two bunches, one straight ahead and to the left toward where the sun would rise, and the other to the shooter's right. Now he dropped over the hen mallard with her string and anchor, and the calling duck bobbed her head under water, and raising and dipping her head, splashed water onto her back.<br><br>"Don't you think it would be good to break more ice around the edges?" the shooter called to the boatman. "There's not much water to attract them."<br><br>The boatman said nothing but commenced to smash at the jagged perimeter of ice with his oar. This ice breaking was unnecessary and the boatman knew it. But the shooter did not know it and he thought, I do not understand him but I must not let him ruin it. I must keep it entire and not let him do it. Every time you shoot now can be the last shoot and no stupid son of a bitch should be allowed to ruin it. Keep your temper, boy, he told himself.<br><br>Copyright � 1950 by Ernest Hemmingway<br><br>Copyright renewed � 1978 by Mary Hemmingway</p><h2>ITIL For Dummies, 2011 Edition</h2><p><i>ITIL For Dummies</i> provides an easy-to-understand introduction to using best practice guidance within IT service management.

Edited and with an introduction by his grandson Sean, and with a foreword from his son Patrick, Hemingway on Hunting chronicles Ernest Hemingway's lifelong zeal for the hunting life, from the plains of Africa to the American West. Hemingway found in hunting the virtues of courage and skill, qualities that he admired greatly and would incorporate into so many other aspects of his life and work. Hunting was not only a pursuit of great passion for him - a thrilling activity in its own right - but it also provided him with a model by which to explore fundamental issues of human nature. His unique ability to isolate these issues into prose has produced the most classic writings of the sport in existence. His famous account of an African safari "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber," "The Snows of Kilimanjaro," passages about duck hunting from Across the River and into the Trees, extensive selections from Green Hills of Africa, and other important short stories, along with numerous selections from his journalistic pieces for Esquire, Vogue, and others, including such works as his "Tanganyika Letters" and his account of hunting in Clark's Fork Valley, Wyoming, make this a definitive summary of a master sportsman, hunter, and writer, and a must-have for anyone who has ever tasted the thrill of the hunt or who simply enjoys great writing. (7 1/4 x 9 1/2, 334 pages, b&amp;w photos)<br>Ernest Hemingway did more to change the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> immediately established Hemingway as one of the greatest literary lights of the twentieth century. As part of the expatriate community in 1920s Paris, the former journalist and World War I ambulance driver began a career that led to international fame. Hemingway was an aficionado of bullfighting and big-game hunting, and his main protagonists were always men and women of courage and conviction who suffered unseen scars, both physical and emotional. He covered the Spanish Civil War, portraying it in the novel <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>, and he also covered World War II. His classic novella <i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.</p><h2>Anthem</h2><p>He lived in the dark ages of the future. In a loveless world he dared to love the woman of his choice and he had the courage to seek after knowledge.

By the author of &#34;We the Living&#34;.</p><p>He lived in the dark ages of the future. In a loveless world he dared to love the woman of his choice. In an age that had lost all trace of science and civilization he had the courage to seek and find knowledge. But these were not the crime for which he would be hunted. He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: he had stood forth from the mindless human herd. He was a man alone.<p>Ayn Rand's classic tale of a future dark age of the great "We" -- in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values -- anticipates her later masterpieces, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.</p>Ayn Rand&#39;s first novel, We the Living, was published in 1936. With the publication of The Fountainhead in 1943, she achieved spectacular and enduring success.

Improved spacecraft measurements of the distances to the stars (recently released by the European Space Agency) are included in the charts, along with additional observing tips for stargazers using binoculars and telescopes. An expanded chapter on Astrophotography lists the best modern films and cameras for skyshooting. </p><p> The new <b>NightWatch</b> is faithful to the "ultra-simplified, no jargon" philosophy of the original, and at the same time, offers substantially more practical information for the novice and intermediate-level amateur astronomer. The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada called the first edition "the best of its kind"- the new Third Edition is better still. It is still an abundantly illustrated, wide-sized volume designed for easy reference during many starlit nights. </p></p><p>The third edition of <i>Nightwatch</i> continues its tradition of being the best handbook for the beginning astronomer. Terence Dickinson covers <i>all</i> the problems beginners face, starting with the fact that the night sky does not look the way a modern city-dweller expects. He discusses light pollution, how to choose binoculars and telescopes, how to pronounce the names of stars and constellations, telescope mounts, averted vision, and why the harvest moon looks especially bright. Most of the lovely photographs in the book were taken by amateurs, which gives the section on astrophotography a particularly inspirational gleam.<p> Dickinson's star charts are very handy, each covering a reasonable field of view and mapping the most interesting amateur objects. He gives good advice for planet watching, which he notes "is one of the few astronomical activities that can be conducted almost as well from the city as from dark rural locations."</p><p> Altogether, the watchword for <i>Nightwatch</i> is indeed "practical"--this is a book to be used, not just read. Spiral-bound to lie flat or to fold back undamaged, it's a field guide that pulls its own weight in the field. Author Timothy Ferris says, "Like a good night sky, <i>Nightwatch</i> is clear and wind-free. Try it and see for yourself." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><p> <b>Terence Dickinson</b> is a prolific science writer specializing in astronomy. More than one million copies of his previous books are in print in three languages. He is the recipient of many national and international science awards including the New York Academy of Sciences Book of the Year Award and the Royal Canadian Institute's Sandford Fleming Medal. He resides in a village just north of Kingston, Ontario. </p></p><h2>The Steadicam� Operator&#39;s Handbook</h2><p>Camera operators and video enthusiasts around the world search for the training and information they need to successfully use the Steadicam�, the most versatile tool for moving a motion picture or video camera.

The result is a history of his love for Beatrice, the muse he encountered in childhood who continued to influence him long after her marriage and early death. Upon completing this work in 1294, the future author of <i>The Divine Comedy</i> pledged to write of Beatrice "what has never before been written of any woman."<br>Instructors and students of Italian, as well as anyone interested in the masterworks of world literature, will appreciate this dual-language edition. It features a new English translation, in addition to an informative introduction and helpful notes.</p><p></p><h2>Aristotle&#39;s Economic Thought</h2><p>Since the middle ages, Aristotle has been hailed as the father of economics by economists, while classical scholars hold that he did no economics at all, only ethics. This book argues that Aristotle does develop a coherent theory of value, wealth, exchange, and money, which is strongly supported by his metaphysics. But its very metaphysical foundation make the theory impossible to assimilate to Neo-Classical economics or any other kind of economic thinking, and it therefore remains an ethical theory. On Aristotelian metaphysical principles, ethics and economics are competitors over the same ground--as rival sources of reasons for decision-making in tihe public realm, and they cannot be reconciled.<br></p><p>It is argued here that Aristotle does develop a coherent theory of economic value, wealth, exchange, and money, but that this theory cannot be assimilated to what we call &#39;economics&#39; because its metaphysical foundation is incompatible with the Human metaphysics on which economics is built.Scott Meikle is at University of Glasgow.</p><h2>Teaching Social Skills to Youth with Mental Health Disorders: Incorporating Social Skills Into Treatment Planning for 109 Disorders</h2><p>Here is a guide for therapists, counselors, psychologists, educators, and other practitioners to incorporate the teaching of social skills as a component of treatment for children diagnosed with mental health disorders. Research and experience show that children and adolescents who struggle with emotional, behavioral and social problems do improve when they learn prosocial skills. Included is an introduction to the DSM-IV-TR and other mental health assessment and evaluation tools and guidance for how to individualize treatment plans while considering children&#39;s developmental, cultural, behavioral, emotional social, genetic, and biological variables. Following a discussion of the importance and effectiveness of skill teaching in the treatment of mental health disorders, the authors provide a series of charts that list the social skills that caregivers and treatment providers might target for each of more than a hundred DSM-IV-TR diagnoses common for children and adolescents. Examples of treatment plans show how social skills can be integrated into plans across different settings and levels of care - home and school, foster care, residential group home, and psychiatric facility. Teaching Social Skills to Youth with Mental Health Disorders can help and encourage any professional striving to improve the lives of troubled youth.</p><p>Dr. Jennifer Resetar Volz is a licensed psychologist and Dr. Tara Snyder is a licensed mental health professional and provisionally licensed psychologist working with children and families at the Boys Town Behavioral Pediatrics and Family Services Outpatient Clinic.

It has had tremendous value for stimulating research, but it only describes the reality of human-environment interactions in special situations. Research over the past thirty years has helped clarify how human motivations, rules governing access to resources, the structure of social organizations, and the resource systems themselves interact to determine whether or not the many dramas of the commons end happily. In this book, leaders in the field review the evidence from several disciplines and many lines of research and present a state-of-the-art assessment. They summarize lessons learned and identify the major challenges facing any system of governance for resource management. They also highlight the major challenges for the next decade: making knowledge development more systematic; understanding institutions dynamically; considering a broader range of resources (such as global and technological commons); and taking into account the effects of social and historical context. This book will be a valuable and accessible introduction to the field for students and a resource for advanced researchers.</p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>1 The Drama of the Commons</li><li><b>Part I: Resource Users, Resource Systems, and Behavior in the Drama of the Commons</b></li><li>2 Common Resources and Institutional Sustainability</li><li>3 Unequal Irrigators: Heterogeneity and Commons Management in Large-Scale</li><li>4 Factors Influencing Cooperation in Commons Dilemmas: A Review of Experimental Psychological Research</li><li>5 Appropriating the Commons: A Theoretical Explanation</li><li><b>Part II: Privatization and Its Limitations</b></li><li>6 The Tradable Permits Approach to Protecting the Commons: What Have We Learned?</li><li>7 Common Property, Regulatory Property, and Environmental Protection: Comparing Community-Based Management to Tradable Environmental Allowances</li><li><b>Part III: Cross-Scale Linkages and Dynamic Interactions</b></li><li>8 Institutional Interplay: The Environmental Consequences of Cross-Scale Interactions</li><li>9 Cross-Scale Institutional Linkages: Perspectives from the Bottom Up</li><li><b>Part IV: Emerging Issues</b></li><li>10 Scientific Uncertainty, Complex Systems, and the Design of Common-Pool Institutions</li><li>11 Emergence of Institutions for the Commons: Contexts, Situations, and Events</li><li>12 An Evolutionary Theory of Commons Management</li><li>13 Knowledge and Questions After 15 Years of Research</li><li>About the Contributors</li><li>Index</li></ul></p><p>Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change, Elinor Ostrom, Thomas Dietz, Nives Dolsak, Paul C.

When the ironclad USS Monitor steamed out to meet the CSS Virginia on 9 March 1862, the face of naval warfare was changed forever. A four-hour duel left neither ship victorious, but in the wake of the battle wooden warships were rendered obsolete. This book details the clash at Hampton Roads, as well as tracing the development of ironclads within the Union and Confederate fleets. Union ironclads evolved quickly from the time of the production of the Monitor, so that by the end of the war the US Navy possessed the most powerful artillery afloat. The Confederate fleet, meanwhile, was born out of the hulks of existing vessels in naval yards and backwaters within sight of the enemy its very existence was a tribute to the ingenuity of Southern shipbuilders.</p><p>When the ironclad USS Monitor steamed out to meet the CSS Virginia on 9 March 1862, the face of naval warfare was changed forever.

In 1983, she wrote a mas-ter&#x2019;s thesis on gifted behavior and published two articles on that subject in Educational Leader-ship in 1983 and 1984. One of those articles caught the attention of Benjamin S.

In 1986, she wrote her Ph.D. dissertation on gifted behavior as a developmental process rather than an innate and unchanging trait. Essentially, she asked the question, &#x201c;What are the behaviors that people use to originate and create high-quality original products in the talent area of their choice?&#x201d; The 10 behaviors that she found to be correlated with this type of success are perceptiveness, active interaction with the environment, reflectiveness, persistence, independence, goal orientation, originality, productivity, self-evaluation, and com-munication of findings.<br>She published the Gifted Behavior Index and her first book, A Thoughtful Overview of Gifted Education, in 1990.<br>Turning her attention to teacher education as a professor of education at DePaul University in Chicago, Judy reinterpreted her construct of gifted behavior in terms of teacher education, and called this related construct &#x201c;reflective actions in teaching.&#x201d; This time she asked the question, &#x201c;What are the behaviors or actions that teachers use to create high-quality original school curric-ula and programs to meet the needs of their students?&#x201d; The answers to this question are contained in this textbook as a model and operational definition of reflective action teaching.

Equally instructive and stimulating is the acute analysis of the play's dramatic elements, its characters, scenes, conflicts, actions, speeches.... This edition far surpasses its predecessors in vitality, sympathy, and scope."--W.B. Stanford, <em>Hermathena</em> LXV. Including a comprehensive discussion of the play's background and an incisive assessment of its dramatic structure, this edition makes an outstanding contribution to Euripides scholarship.</p><p>Classical Greek drama is brought vividly to life in this series of new translations. Students are encouraged to engage with the text through detailed commentaries, including suggestions for discussion and analysis. In addition, numerous practical questions stimulate ideas on staging and encourage students to explore the play&#39;s dramatic qualities. Bacchae is suitable for students of both Classical Civilisation and Drama. Useful features include full synopsis of the play, commentary alongside translation for easy reference and a comprehensive introduction to the Greek Theatre. Bacchae is aimed primarily at A-level and undergraduate students in the UK, and college students in North America.Euripides (c. 480-406 BCE) was the last of the three great tragedians of classical Athens.

This is a work that resonates with Vonnegut¿s singular voice: the magic sound of a born storyteller mesmerizing us with truth.</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut is a unique voice in the American canon &#x2014; a writer whose works are hard to categorize, often straddling the space between literature and science fiction, and filled with cutting satire and dark humor. Like Mark Twain before him, Vonnegut's reputation and impact on American writing and reading will continue to grow steadily and increase in relevance as new insights are made. Vonnegut was born in 1922 in Indianapolis, and studied at the University of Chicago and the University of Tennessee. In the Second World War, he became a German prisoner of war and was present during the bombing of Dresden. This experience provided inspiration for his most successful and influential novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut &#x2014; admired as much for his views and his &#x201c;Vonnegutisms&#x201d; as for his publications &#x2014; wrote extensively in many forms, including novels, short stories, essays, plays, articles, speeches, and correspondence, some of which was published posthumously.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br><i>The First Amendment<br></i><br>I am a member of what I believe to be the last recognizable generation of full-time, life-time American novelists. We appear to be standing more or less in a row. It was the Great Depression which made us similarly edgy and watchful. It was World War II which lined us up so nicely, whether we were men or women, whether we were ever in uniform or not. It was an era of romantic anarchy in publishing which gave us money and mentors, willy-nilly, when we were young&#x2013;while we learned our craft. Words printed on pages were still the principal form of long-distance communication and stored information in America when we were young.<br><br>No more.<br><br>Nor are there many publishers and editors and agents left who are eager to find some way to get money and other forms of encouragement to young writers who write as clumsily as member of my literary generation did when we started out. The wild and wonderful and expensive guess was made back then that we might acquire some wisdom and learn how to write halfway decently by and by. Writers were needed that much back then.<br><br>It was an amusing and instructive time for writers&#x2013;for hundreds of them.<br><br>Television wrecked the short-story branch of the industry, and now accountants and business school graduates dominate book publishing. They feel that money spent on someone's first novel is good money down a rat hole. They are right. It almost always is.<br><br>So, as I say, I think I belong to America's last generation of novelists. Novelists will come one by one from now on, not in seeming families, and will perhaps write only one or two novels, and let it go at that. Many will have inherited or married money.<br><br>The most influential of my bunch, in my opinion, is still J. D. Salinger, although he has been silent for years. The most promising was perhaps Edward Lewis Wallant, who died so young. And it is my thinking about the death of James Jones two years ago, who was not all that young, who was almost exactly my age, which accounts for the autumnal mood of this book. There have been other reminders of my own mortality, to be sure, but the death of Jones is central&#x2013;perhaps because I see his widow Gloria so often and because he, too, was a self-educated midwesterner, and because he, too, in a major adventure for all of us, which was the Second World War, had been an enlisted man. And let it here be noted that the best-known members of my literary generation, if they wrote about war, almost unanimously despised officers and made heroes of sketchily educated, aggressively unaristocratic enlisted men.<br><br>� � �<br><br>James Jones told me one time that his publisher and Ernest Hemingway's, Charles Scribner's Sons, had once hoped to get Jones and Hemingway together&#x2013;so that they could enjoy each other's company as old warriors.<br><br>Jones declined, by his own account, because he did not regard Hemingway as a fellow soldier. He said Hemingway in wartime was free to come and go from the fighting as he pleased, and to take time off for a fine meal or woman or whatever. Real soldiers, according to Jones, damn well had to stay where they were told, or go where they were told, and eat swill, and take the worst the enemy had to throw at them day after day, week after week.<br><br>� � �<br><br>It may be that the most striking thing about members of my literary generation in retrospect will be that we were allowed to say absolutely anything without fear of punishment. Our American heirs may find it incredible, as most foreigners do right now, that a nation would want to enforce as a law something which sounds more like a dream, which reads as follows:<br><br>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."<br><br>How could a nation with such a law raise its children in an atmosphere of decency? It couldn't&#x2013;it can't. So the law will surely be repealed soon for the sake of children.<br><br>And even now my books, along with books by Bernard Malamud and James Dickey and Joseph Heller and many other first-rate patriots, are regularly thrown out of public-school libraries by school board members, who commonly say that they have not actually read the books, but that they have it on good authority that the books are bad for children.<br><br>� � �<br><br>My novel <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> was actually burned in a furnace by a school janitor in Drake, North Dakota, on instructions from the school committee there, and the school board made public statements about the unwholesomeness of the book. Even by the standards of Queen Victoria, the only offensive line in th entire novel is this: "Get out of the road, you dumb motherfucker." This is spoken by an American antitank gunner to an unarmed American chaplain's assistant during the Battle of the Bulge in Europe in December 1944, the largest single defeat of American arms (the Confederacy excluded) in history. The chaplain's assistant had attracted enemy fire.<br><br>So on November 16, 1973, I wrote as follows to Charles McCarthy of Drake, North Dakota:<br><br>Dear Mr. McCarthy:<br><br>I am writing to you in your capacity as chairman of the Drake School Board. I am among those American writers whose books have been destroyed in the now famous furnace of your school.<br><br>Certain members of your community have suggested that my work is evil. This is extraordinarily insulting to me. The news from Drake indicates to me that books and writers are very unreal to you people. I am writing this letter to let you know how real I am.<br><br>I want you to know, too, that my publisher and I have done absolutely nothing to exploit the disgusting news from Drake. We are not clapping each other on the back, crowing about all the books we will sell because of the news. We have declined to go on television, have written no fiery letters to editorial pages, have granted no lengthy interviews. We are angered and sickened and saddened. And no copies of this letter have been sent to anybody else. You now hold the only copy in your hands. It is a strictly private letter from me to the people of Drake, who have done so much to damage my reputation in the eyes of their children and then in the eyes of the world. Do you have the courage and ordinary decency to show this letter to the people, or will it, too, be consigned to the fires of your furnace?<br><br>I gather from what I read in the papers and hear on television that you imagine me, and some other writers, too, as being sort of ratlike people who enjoy making money from poisoning the minds of young people. I am in fact a large, strong person, fifty-one years old, who did a lot of farm work as a boy, who is good with tools. I have raised six children, three my own and three adopted. They have all turned out well. Two of them are farmers. I am a combat infantry veteran from World War II, and hold a Purple Heart. I have earned whatever I own by hard work. I have never been arrested or sued for anything. I am so much trusted with young people and by young people that I have served on the faculties of the University of Iowa, Harvard, and the City College of New York. Every year I receive at least a dozen invitations to be commencement speaker at colleges and high schools. My books are probably more widely used in schools than those of any other living American fiction writer.<br><br>If you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don't damage children much. They didn't damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.<br><br>After I have said all this. I am sure you are still ready to respond, in effect, "Yes, yes&#x2013;but it still remains our right and our responsibility to decide what books our children are going to be made to read in our community." This is surely so. But it is also true that if you exercise that right and fulfill that responsibility in an ignorant, harsh, un-American manner, then people are entitled to call you bad citizens and fools. Even your own children are entitled to call you that.<br><br>I read in the newspaper that your community is mystified by the outcry from all over the country about what you have done. Well, you have discovered that Drake is a part of American civilization, and your fellow Americans can't stand it that you have behaved in such an uncivilized way. Perhaps you will learn from this that books are sacred to free men for very good reasons, and that wars have been fought against nations which hate books and burn them. If you are an American, you must allow all ideas to circulate freely in your community, not merely your own.<br><br>If you and your board are now determined to show that you in fact have wisdom and maturity when you exercise your powers over the eduction of your young, then you should acknowledge that it was a rotten lesson you taught young people in a free society when you denounced and then burned books&#x2013;books you hadn't even read. You should also resolve to expose your children to all sorts of opinions and information, in order that they will be better equipped to make decisions and to survive.<br><br>Again: you have insulted me, and I am a good citizen, and I am very real.<br><br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br><br>That was seven years ago. There has so far been no reply. At this very moment, as I write in New York City, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> has been banned from school libraries not fifty miles from here. A legal battle begun several years ago rages on. The school board in question has found lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment tooth and nail. There is never a shortage anywhere of lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment, as though it were nothing more than a clause in a lease from a crooked slumlord.<br><br>At the start of that particular litigation, on March 24th of 1976, I wrote a comment for the Op-Ed page of the Long Island edition of <i>The New York Times</i>. It went like this:<br><br>A school board has denounced some books again&#x2013;out in Levittown this time. One of the books was mine. I hear about un-American nonsense like this twice a year or so. One time out in North Dakota, the books were actually burned in a furnace. I had a laugh. It was such an ignorant, dumb, superstitious thing to do.<br><br>It was so cowardly, too&#x2013;to make a great show of attacking artifacts. It was like St. George attacking bedspreads and cuckoo clocks.<br><br>Yes, and St. Georges like that seem to get elected or appointed to school committees all the time. They are actually proud of their illiteracry. They imagine that they are somehow celebrating the bicentennial when they boast, as some did in Levittown, that they hadn't actually read the books they banned.<br><br>Such lunks are often the backbone of volunteer fire departments and the United States Infantry and cake sales and so on, and they have been thanked often enough for that. But they have no business supervising the eductions of children in a free society.

I discussed that some at a fund raiser for the American Civil Liberties Union at Sands Point, New York, out on Long Island, on September 16, 1979.

I will tell you my dim memories of what he said about the hierarchy of laws on this planet, which was flat at the time. The highest law, he said, was divine law, God's law.

Enemies of the Bill of Rights do the same sort of thing all the time, so why shouldn't we? Divine law, then, is an ace. Natural law is a king. The Bill of Rights is a lousy queen.<br><br>"The Thomist hierarchy of laws is so far from being ridiculous that I have never met anybody who did not believe in it right down to the marrow of his or her bones. Everybody knows that there are laws with more grandeur than those which are printed in our statute books. The big trouble is that there is so little agreement as to how those grander laws are worded. Theologians can give us hints of the wording, but it takes a dictator to set them down just right&#x2013;to dot the <i>i</i>'s and cross the <i>t</i>'s.

He had fistfuls of aces and kings to play.<br><br>"Meanwhile, over on this side of the Atlantic, we were not playing with a full deck, as they say. Because of our Constitution, the highest card anybody had to play was a lousy queen, contemptible human law. That remains true today.

This First Folio text, printed from a transcript by King&#39;s Mens scrivener Ralph Crane of Shakespeare&#39;s own foul papers, preserves Shakespeare&#39;s authorial process, including his changes in plot, character, theme and structure. As such it offers a unique view of the author&#39;s writing and rewriting of his own play. Once dismissed as an &#39;assembled&#39; text or as a &#39;darkened&#39; text, adapted or botched by later revisers, the Folio text instead presents a superbly written play about intensely complex issues, including the uses of morality and sexuality. The original and genuine text of Measure, For Measure offers Shakespeare at his most brilliant and intricate.</p><p>John Dover Wilson&#39;s New Shakespeare, published between 1921 and 1966, became the classic Cambridge edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems until the 1980s.

Adolescent medicine is a constantly evolving field requiring frequent incorporation of newer data, research, and resources. In this regard, the authors meet the objectives. The book is written for all healthcare professionals involved in the care of adolescents. &#34;Beginning with a brief overview of normal pubertal changes and physiology, the book then comprehensively addresses commonly encountered abnormalities and variations from the norm. Relevant issues such as obesity, hypertension, sports participation, and topics related to sexual activity, are well represented. Also quite useful are the various algorithms, health forms, and web sites which can be provided to patients and their families for further research and education. &#34;This will be an invaluable reference in day-to-day care of adolescent patients and their families. The new chapters, updates of existing chapters, and the addition of pertinent websites justify this fifth edition.&#34;-Doody&#39;s Book Review Service (Weighted Numerical Score: 94; 4 Stars)</p><h2>Mr Perrin and Mr Traill (Capuchin Classics)</h2><p>Many books have been written about the horror of boys public schools. Comparatively few, however, venture beyond the staff-room door to examine the suffering of masters as well as pupils. Of those that do, there is probably none that captures the wretchedness of their cloistered life more vividly than Mr Perrin and Mr Traill. Based in part on his own experiences as a boarder at King s School, Canterbury, Walpole reflected that Mr Perrin and Mr Traill was probably the truest of all his novels.</p><p>Hugh Walpole (1884&#x2013;1941)&nbsp;was a former schoolmaster and&nbsp;novelist whose other titles include <i>The Dark Forest</i> and <i>The Secret City</i>.

The story of Flem Snopes' ruthless struggle to take over the town of Jefferson, Mississippi, the book is rich in typically Faulknerian episodes of humor and of profundity.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>William Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897. His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously.<br><br>Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, <b>The Marble Faun</b>, at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, <b>Soldier&#x2019;s Pay</b>, was published in 1926, followed a year later by <b>Mosquitoes</b>, a literary satire. His next book, <b>Flags in the Dust</b>, was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher&#x2019;s insistence and appeared finally as <b>Sartoris</b> in 1929. In the meantime he had completed <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>, and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished <b>Sanctuary</b> and was ready to begin writing <b>As I Lay Dying</b>. That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier.<br><br>Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels&#x2014;<b>Light in August</b> (1932), <b>Pylon</b> (1935), <b>Absalom, Absalom!</b> (1936), <b>The Unvanquished</b> (1938), <b>The Wild Palms</b> (1939), <b>The Hamlet</b> (1940), and <b>Go Down, Moses</b> (1942)&#x2014;and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on <b>To Have and Have Not</b>, <b>The Big Sleep</b>, and <b>Land of the Pharaohs</b>, among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology <b>The Portable Faulkner</b> brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature.<br><br>Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>. &#x201c;No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner&#x2019;s imagination,&#x201d; Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley&#x2019;s anthology. &#x201c;The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers&#x2014;all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations.&#x201d; In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books&#x2014;<b>Intruder in the Dust</b> (1948), <b>Requiem for a Nun</b> (1951), <b>A Fable</b> (1954), <b>The Town</b> (1957), <b>The Mansion</b> (1959), and <b>The Reivers</b> (1962)&#x2014;he continued to explore what he had called &#x201c;the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,&#x201d; but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha&#x2019;s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.Chapter 1<br><br>Charles Mallison<br><br>I wasn't born yet so it was Cousin Gowan who was there and big enough to see and remember and tell me afterward when I was big enough for it to make sense. That is, it was Cousin Gowan plus Uncle Gavin or maybe Uncle Gavin rather plus Cousin Gowan. He-Cousin Gowan-was thirteen. His grandfather was Grandfather's brother so by the time it got down to us, he and I didn't know what cousin to each other we were. So he just called all of us except Grandfather 'cousin' and all of us except Grandfather called him 'cousin' and let it go at that.<br><br>They lived in Washington, where his father worked for the State Department, and all of a sudden the State Department sent his father to China or India or some far place, to be gone two years; and his mother was going too so they sent Gowan down to stay with us and go to school in Jefferson until they got back. 'Us' was Grandfather and Mother and Father and Uncle Gavin then. So this is what Gowan knew about it until I got born and big enough to know about it too. So when I say 'we' and 'we thought' what I mean is Jefferson and what Jefferson thought.<br><br>At first we thought that the water tank was only Flem Snopes's monument. We didn't know any better then. It wasn't until afterward that we realised that that object low on the sky above Jefferson, Mississippi, wasn't a monument at all. It was a footprint.<br><br>One day one summer he drove up the southeast road into town in a two- mule wagon containing his wife and baby and a small assortment of house-furnishings. The next day he was behind the counter of a small back-alley restaurant which belonged to V. K. Ratliff. That is, Ratliff owned it with a partner, since he-Ratliff-had to spend most of his time in his buckboard (this was before he owned the Model T Ford) about the county with his demonstrator sewing machine for which he was the agent. That is, we thought Ratliff was still the other partner until we saw the stranger in the other greasy apron behind the counter- a squat uncommunicative man with a neat minute bow tie and opaque eyes and a sudden little hooked nose like the beak of a small hawk; a week after that, Snopes had set up a canvas tent behind the restaurant and he and his wife and baby were living in it. And that was when Ratliff told Uncle Gavin:<br><br>"Just give him time. Give him six months and he'll have Grover Cleveland" (Grover Cleveland Winbush was the partner) "out of that caf� too."<br><br>That was the first summer, the first Summer of the Snopes, Uncle Gavin called it. He was in Harvard now, working for his M.A. After that he was going to the University of Mississippi law school to get ready to be Grandfather's partner. But already he was spending the vacations helping Grandfather be City Attorney; he had barely seen Mrs Snopes yet so he not only didn't know he would ever go to Germany to enter Heidelberg University, he didn't even know yet that he would ever want to: only to talk about going there someday as a nice idea to keep in mind or to talk about.<br><br>He and Ratliff talked together a lot. Because although Ratliff had never been to school anywhere much and spent his time travelling about our county selling sewing machines (or selling or swapping or trading anything else for that matter), he and Uncle Gavin were both interested in people-or so Uncle Gavin said. Because what I always thought they were mainly interested in was curiosity. Until this time, that is. Because this time it had already gone a good deal further than just curiosity. This time it was alarm.<br><br>Ratliff was how we first began to learn about Snopes. Or rather, Snopeses. No, that's wrong: there had been a Snopes in Colonel Sartoris's cavalry command in 1864-in that part of it whose occupation had been raiding Yankee picket-lines for horses. Only this time it was a Confederate picket which caught him-that Snopes-raiding a Confederate horse-line and, it was believed, hung him. Which was evidently wrong too, since (Ratliff told Uncle Gavin) about ten years ago Flem and an old man who seemed to be his father appeared suddenly from nowhere one day and rented a little farm from Mr Will Varner who just about owned the whole settlement and district called Frenchman's Bend about twenty miles from Jefferson. It was a farm so poor and small and already wornout that only the most trifling farmer would undertake it, and even they stayed only one year. Yet Ab and Flem rented it and evidently (this is Ratliff) he or Flem or both of them together found it&#x2014;<br><br>"Found what?" Uncle Gavin said.<br><br>"I dont know," Ratliff said. "Whatever it was Uncle Billy and Jody had buried out there and thought was safe."-because that winter Flem was the clerk in Uncle Billy's store. And what they found on that farm must have been a good one, or maybe they didn't even need it anymore; maybe Flem found something else the Varners thought was hidden and safe under the counter of the store itself. Because in another year old Ab had moved into Frenchman's Bend to live with his son and another Snopes had appeared from somewhere to take over the rented farm; and in two years more still another Snopes was the official smith in Mr Varner's blacksmith shop. So there were as many Snopeses in Frenchman's Bend as there were Varners; and five years after that, which was the year Flem moved to Jefferson, there were even more Snopeses than Varners because one Varner was married to a Snopes and was nursing another small Snopes at her breast.<br><br>Because what Flem found that last time was inside Uncle Billy's house. She was his only daughter and youngest child, not just a local belle but a belle throughout that whole section. Nor was it just because of old Will's land and money. Because I saw her too and I knew what it was too, even if she was grown and married and with a child older than I was and I only eleven and twelve and thirteen. ("Oh ay," Uncle Gavin said. "Even at twelve dont think you are the first man ever chewed his bitter thumbs for that like reason such as her.") She wasn't too big, heroic, what they call Junoesque. It was that there was just too much of what she was for any just one human female package to contain and hold: too much of white, too much of female, too much of maybe just glory, I dont know: so that at first sight of her you felt a kind of shock of gratitude just for being alive and being male at the same instant with her in space and time, and then in the next second and forever after<br><br>a kind of despair because you knew that there never would<br><br>be enough of any one male to match and hold and deserve<br><br>her; grief forever after because forever after nothing less would ever do.<br><br>That was what he found this time. One day, according to Ratliff, Frenchman's Bend learned that Flem Snopes and Eula Varner had driven across the line into the next county the night before and bought a license and got married; the same day, still according to Ratliff, Frenchman's Bend learned that three young men, three of Eula's old suitors, had left the country suddenly by night too, for Texas it was said, or anyway west, far enough west to be longer than Uncle Billy or Jody Varner could have reached if they had needed to try. Then a month later Flem and Eula also departed for Texas (that bourne, Uncle Gavin said, in our time for the implicated the insolvent or the merely hopeful), to return the next summer with a girl baby a little larger than you would have expected at only three months&#x2014;<br><br>"And the horses," Uncle Gavin said. Because we did know about that, mainly because Flem Snopes had not been the first to import them. Every year or so someone brought into the county a string of wild unbroken plains ponies from somewhere in the west and auctioned them off. This time the ponies arrived, in the charge of a man who was obviously from Texas, at the same time that Mr and Mrs Snopes returned home from that state. This string however seemed to be uncommonly wild, since the resultant scattering of the untamed and untameable calico-splotched animals covered not just Frenchman's Bend but the whole east half of the county too. Though even to the last, no one ever definitely connected Snopes with their ownership. "No no," Uncle Gavin said. "You were not one of the three that ran from the smell of Will Varner's shotgun. And dont tell me Flem Snopes traded you one of those horses for your half of that restaurant because I wont believe it. What was it?"<br><br>Ratliff sat there with his bland brown smoothly-shaven face and his neat tieless blue shirt and his shrewd intelligent gentle eyes not quite looking at Uncle Gavin. "It was that old house," he said. Uncle Gavin waited. "The Old Frenchman place." Uncle Gavin waited. "That buried money." Then Uncle Gavin understood: not an old pre-Civil War plantation house in all Mississippi or the South either but had its legend of the money and plate buried in the flower garden from Yankee raiders;-in this particular case, the ruined mansion which in the old time had dominated and bequeathed its name to the whole section known as Frenchman's Bend, which the Varners now owned. "It was Henry Armstid's fault, trying to get even with Flem for that horse that Texas man sold him that broke his leg. No," Ratliff said, "it was me too as much as anybody else, as any of us. To figger out what Flem was doing owning that old place that anybody could see wasn't worth nothing. I dont mean why Flem bought it. I mean, why he even taken it when Uncle Billy give it to him and Eula for a wedding gift. So when Henry taken to following and watching Flem and finally caught him that night digging in that old flower garden, I dont reckon Henry had to persuade me very hard to go back the next night and watch Flem digging myself."<br><br>"So when Flem finally quit digging and went away, you and Henry crawled out of the bushes and dug too," Uncle Gavin said. "And found it. Some of it. Enough of it. Just exactly barely enough of it for you to hardly wait for daylight to swap Flem Snopes your half of that restaurant for your half of the Old Frenchman place. How much longer did you and Henry dig before ...</p><h2>Electronic principles</h2><p>Designed for use in courses such as electronic devices or electronic circuits, this edition features a new chapter on communication circuits, as well as performance objectives for each chapter.

Worse still, these fanatics operated under the protection and sponsorship of rogue states ruled by ruthless and cunning dictators. As timely and familiar as these events may seem, they occurred more than two centuries ago. The president was Thomas Jefferson, and the terrorists were the Barbary pirates of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. <p>Victory in Tripoli recounts the untold story of one of the defining challenges overcome by the young U.S. republic. This fast-moving and dramatic tale examines the events that gave birth to the Navy and the Marines, recounting the harrowing experiences of U.S. seamen held as slaves in North Africa for more than a decade and re-creating the startling political, diplomatic, and military battles that were central to the conflict. </p><p>The story begins with humiliation: a U.S. warship&#x2014;the first ever in the Mediterranean Sea&#x2014;sailing into the harbor of Algiers to pay protection money to Algerine ruler Dey Bobba Mustafa. This custom of paying pirates not to attack merchant vessels, long practiced by the European powers, rankled the ship's captain, William Bainbridge, as well as U.S. consuls Richard O'Brien and William Eaton. Over the next five years, these men, along with a handful of others, would do everything in their power to end this policy of appeasement and bring U.S. power to bear against the Barbary pirates.</p><p>Standing alone against the pirates, the United States resorted to naval blockades, covert operations and night raids, amphibious assaults, brute force, attempted regime change through a coup d'�tat, employment of mercenary forces, and, finally, the betrayal of a trusted ally in its quest for victory. The young nation would learn valuable lessons in cross-cultural diplomacy, diplomatic maneuvering, and the projection of military might as an extension of public policy.</p><p>Victory in Tripoli examines every aspect of the first U.S. military campaign through foreign lands&#x2014;from the spectacular naval heroics of the legendary Stephen Decatur to Eaton's perilous march across the Sahara, from Jefferson's flip-flopping on the use of force to petty squabbles among diplomats that produced dire consequences for the United States. This highly interesting and informative history offers deep insight into issues that remain fundamental to U.S. foreign policy decisions to this day.</p>"This is a tale of piracy, heroism, disaster, triumph, and American exceptionalism.

William Eaton, United States consul to Tunis, was furious. Eaton, however, was not a man given to impotent rage. He was intent on ending the custom of paying protection money to the Barbary pirates of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. His plan: to reverse the roles of diplomacy in the region by taking the fight straight to the piratical regimes.</p><p>Over the next five years, the fledgling U.S. Navy would develop into a formidable force as it employed blockades, covert operations, amphibious assaults, brute force, and even mercenaries to make the Mediterranean safe for U.S. merchant ships. Victory in Tripoli tells the inspiring story of how Eaton and a few other determined Americans forced their young nation to stand up to terrorism.

On the other side of the spectrum, academics have studied the Bible using scientific analysis to examine its historical significance and meaning. The gap between these readings has resulted in a schism with far-reaching implications: Without historical context, ordinary people are left to interpret the Bible literally, while academic readings overlook the deeply personal connections established in church pews, choir benches, and backyard study groups.</p><p>In <em>How To Read the Bible</em>, Cox explores three different lenses commonly used to bring the Bible into focus:</p><ul> <li> Literary&#x2014;as narrative stories of family conflict, stirring heroism, and moral dilemmas;</li> <li> History&#x2014;as classic texts with academic and theological applications;</li> <li> Activism&#x2014;as a source of dialogue and engagement to be shared and applied to our lives.</li></ul><p>By bringing these together, Cox shows the Bible in all its rich diversity and meaning and offers us a contemporary activist version that wrestles with issues of feminism, war, homosexuality, and race. The result is a living resource that is perpetually evolving as our understanding changes and deepens from generation to generation.</p></p><p><p>For many people, the Bible lies at the heart of their faith, an ageless source of inspiration and guidance. On the other side of the spectrum, trained biblical scholars study the Bible using a variety of modern historical and literary approaches. But there is a wide gap be-tween these two groups of readers, a gap that brings negative consequences for both. Without an awareness of historical context, ordinary readers easily slip into a literal interpretation, while scholars sometimes overlook the deeply personal significance the Bible has for people in churches, synagogues, and Bible study groups.</p><p>In <em>How to Read the Bible</em>, renowned Harvard Divinity School professor Harvey Cox shows how these different ways of approaching the Bible can be reconciled to the enrichment of all. By discussing a range of biblical books from Genesis to Revelation, he demonstrates how the historical analysis of the Bible, rather than undercutting its spiritual significance, can enhance and deepen it. Drawing on some of the commonly used modes of biblical scholarship, such as archaeology, cultural studies, and literary criticism, Cox opens up a rich, diverse, and contemporary version of scripture, one that wrestles with issues of feminism, war, homosexuality, and race. The result is a Bible that is a timeless but contemporary resource for all.</p><p>Harvey Cox is the Hollis Research Professor of Divinity at Harvard University, where he has taught since 1965, both at Harvard Divinity School and in the Harvard Fac- ulty of Arts and Sciences.

Examples abound: think Jackson Pollock dripping resin on a cicada carcass in his shed in the Hamptons. But times have changed; ever since Andy Warhol declared his art space a &#x201c;factory,&#x201d; artists have begun to envision themselves as the leaders of production teams, and their sense of what it means to be in the studio has altered just as dramatically as their practices.</p> <p><i>The Studio Reader</i> pulls back the curtain from the art world to reveal the real activities behind artistic production. What does it mean to be in the studio? What is the space of the studio in the artist&#x2019;s practice? How do studios help artists envision their agency and, beyond that, their own lives? This forward-thinking anthology features an all-star array of contributors, ranging from Svetlana Alpers, Bruce Nauman, and Robert Storr to Daniel Buren, Carolee Schneemann, and Buzz Spector, each of whom locates the studio both spatially and conceptually&#x2014;at the center of an art world that careens across institutions, markets, and disciplines.

To what extent would you remain committed to your current projects and plans? Would scientists still search for a cure for cancer? Would couples still want children?<br><br>In <em>Death and the Afterlife</em>, philosopher Samuel Scheffler poses this thought experiment in order to show that the continued life of the human race after our deaths--the "afterlife" of the title--matters to us to an astonishing and previously neglected degree. Indeed, Scheffler shows that, in certain important respects, the future existence of people who are as yet unborn matters more to us than our own continued existence and the continued existence of those we love. Without the expectation that humanity has a future, many of the things that now matter to us would cease to do so. By contrast, the prospect of our own deaths does little to undermine our confidence in the value of our activities. Despite the terror we may feel when contemplating our deaths, the prospect of humanity's imminent extinction would pose a far greater threat to our ability to lead lives of wholehearted engagement. Scheffler further demonstrates that, although we are not unreasonable to fear death, personal immortality, like the imminent extinction of humanity, would also undermine our confidence in the values we hold dear. His arresting conclusion is that, in order for us to lead value-laden lives, what is necessary is that we ourselves should die and that others should live. <br><br><em>Death and the Afterlife</em> concludes with commentary by four distinguished philosophers--Harry Frankfurt, Niko Kolodny, Seana Shiffrin, and Susan Wolf--who discuss Scheffler's ideas with insight and imagination. Scheffler adds a final reply.<br></p><p><br><strong>Samuel Scheffler</strong> is University Professor in the Department of Philosophy at New York University.

In 2012, he delivered the prestigious Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Berkeley, on which this book is based.<br><br>"...combined with Scheffler's eminently readable (and often humourous!) prose style, and the insightful and provocative exchanges that he has with his similarly-distinguished interlocutors, propels <em>Death and the Afterlife</em> into that rare class of philosophical books that are both valuable and enjoyable." <br>--<em>Analysis</em><p></p><br>"Clearly, this book brings together some impressive intellectual firepower." <br>--<em>Metapsychology Online Reviews</em> <br><p></p><br>"With its careful arguments, counterarguments, and comparative evaluation of alternative hypotheses, this book is a superb example of the application of analytic philosophy to a subject that is of fundamental concern to everyone, not only to academic philosophers. Scheffler has opened up a new range of questions about life and death." <br>--Thomas Nagel, <em>New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Thinking about the end of humanity provides insights into what we value, and why we value it...an insightful look at what death means to us." <br>--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>[Scheffler's] wonderful Tanner Lectures, recently published as <em>Death and the Afterlife</em>, attempt to extract several striking lessons from our supposed reaction to the doomsday scenario....One of the many gems embedded in Scheffler's lectures is a nicely observed contrast between our sense of catastrophic horror in the face of the doomsday and infertility scenarios, and our relative calm in the face of the fact that everyone now living will one day be dead." <br>--Mark Johnston, <em>Boston Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Scheffler has produced a superb essay -- indeed it seems to me about as good as analytic philosophy gets. It is entirely free from obfuscating jargon and other tiresome tricks of the trade, yet it is meticulously argued and demanding in exactly the right way -- forcing us to think about hitherto unexamined implications of our existing beliefs. Though written with agreeable lightness and fluency, it is rich in psychological and ethical insight, and restores philosophy to its proper role of tackling the big structural concerns that are inseparable from the human condition." --John Cottingham, <em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em><p></p><br>"[Scheffler's] discussion of the issues with which he has concerned himself is fresh and original. Moreover, so far as I am aware, those issues are themselves pretty much original with him. He seems really to have raised, within a rigorously philosophical context, some new questions. At least, so far as I know, no one before has attempted to deal with those questions so systematically. So it appears that he has effectively opened up a new and promising field of philosophical inquiry. Not bad going, in a discipline to which many of the very best minds have already devoted themselves for close to three thousand years."--Harry Frankfurt, Princeton University, from "How the Afterlife Matters" (in this volume)<p></p><br>"This is some of the most interesting and best-written philosophy I have read in a long time. Scheffler's book is utterly original in its fundamental conception, brilliant in its analysis and argument, and concise and at times beautiful in its formulation."--Stephen Darwall, Yale University<p></p><br>"A truly wonderful and very important book."--Derek Parfit, Emeritus Fellow, All Souls College, University of Oxford<p></p><br>"Scheffler's book is a beautiful example of philosophical reflection on matters of great significance... He writes in a rigorous but engaging manner about things of obvious importance to us all. <em>Death and the Afterlife</em> is a model of how to make difficult philosophy intelligible to thinking people." --<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"<em>Death and the Afterlife</em> constitutes two remarkable achievements. The first is rare enough. Samuel Scheffler presents us with a set of reflections, the importance, and arguably the correctness, of which seem obvious in retrospect, but which most people will not have previously registered, let alone thought to be of considerable profundity. The second is even rarer. Scheffler appears to be the first person, in nearly 3,000 years of western philosophy, to get to grips, in a sustained and insightful way, with the particular questions his book raises." --<em>Oxonian Review</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Scheffler's thesis has striking implications for the way we should think about the demands of our egos. Our self-interest doesn't merely extend, as we're used to thinking, to the preservation of ourselves and those we love. It extends to the lives of indeterminate future people we neither know nor love." -- <em>London Review of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"A brilliant example of how a thought experiment can make us rethink our values." -- David Edmonds, <em>The Big Issue</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Family Medicine PreTest Self-Assessment And Review, Third Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The closest you can get to seeing the USMLE Step 2 CK without actually taking it</b></p><p><i>Family Medicine: PreTest Self-Assessment &amp; Review</i> is the perfect way to assess your knowledge of Family Medicine for the USMLE Step 2 CK and shelf exams.

This is land that gives little but yields, under pressure, to creative experiments with unusual crops. Stephen Johnson's and Robert Dawson's stunning photographs reveal the immense beauty of the region as well as the delicate relationship between the land and the people who work it.<br><br>The Central Valley is California's economic hub as well as its physical center. A plain some 430 miles long and up to 75 miles wide, surrounded by mountains and covering nearly fifteen million acres&#x2015;about the size of England&#x2015;this valley has become the richest farming region in the world. More than 25 percent of the table food produced in the U.S. is grown here. Its southernmost county, Kern, produces more oil than some OPEC countries.<br><br>The Valley is as rich in people as it is in resources. Tagalog, Hmong, Spanish, English, Cantonese, Russian, Italian&#x2015;all are spoken here. The population of farm laborers, small family farms, powerful agribusinesses, and, increasingly, urban professionals make the region's economic disparities as palpable as its cultural diversity.<br><br>The Valley has also produced a wealth of writers&#x2015;Maxine Hong Kingston from Stockton, Richard Rodriguez and Joan Didion from Sacramento, Gary Soto from Fresno, among others&#x2015;as well as the award-winning <i>El Teatro Campesino</i> (The Farmworkers' Theater).<br><br>But the Valley is imperiled. The past 150 years of massive agricultural expansion and population growth have systematically destroyed much of the area's original wildlife, and the "plain of majestic oaks" seen by early travelers has vanished. The region is also plagued by a host of critical issues: chemical pollution, soil erosion, water politics, the treatment of minorities, economic inequities, farm foreclosures. Johnson's and Dawson's photographs&#x2015;which are complemented by engravings by Thomas Moran, paintings by Albert Bierstadt and William Hahn, and photographs by Carleton Watkins, Dorothea Lange, and Russell Lee, among others&#x2015;bring home to us, as only visual images can, that it is up to us to safeguard the future of this endangered valley, to conserve its extraordinary human and natural wealth, and to try to reclaim some of its lost grandeur.</p><p>This book vividly explores in words and pictures the rich natural and social history of California&#39;s agricultural heartland.<b>Stephen Johnson</b> teaches photography at Skyline College and the College of San Mateo.

Two former sweethearts have suddenly returned to town, reawakening all her youthful traumas, secrets and dreams. Then another death occurs. It appears accidental, but is it?

She stiffened, eyes shut tight.<p> </p><p>She wanted to retreat from the intrusion or jump up from this table and escape. What horrors lay behind the other doors? What had she allowed herself to be talked into? Moral support was one thing, but this--</p><p> </p><p>"Too rough?"</p><p> </p><p>Jill opened her eyes and looked into the upside-down face of twenty-two-year-old Sheena Marshall. "No."</p><p> </p><p>Sheena had an uncommonly bright, perky grin that matched her bright, perky voice. All the employees of this spa seemed to be infected with terminal optimism, except for Sheena's mother, Mary Marshall, who had always been on the opposite end of that spectrum, even when Jill had graduated from high school with her twenty-seven years ago.</p><p> </p><p>Today, Mary's daughter was actually perkier than usual. "It's fine." Jill wanted to ask when the sheets had last been washed on this massage table, but the question could eventually reach the ears of the owner of this establishment.</p><p> </p><p>Jill was here to provide the owner--her baby sister--moral support for this venture, not to irritate her. Noelle Trask ran a tight ship, and these sheets would be pristine. She would not take kindly to having her employees verbally abused, or even questioned by a client with a few...inter-esting...hang-ups. Especially if that client just happened to be her bossy older sister.</p><p> </p><p>Who would have thought Noelle, the wild child of Hide-away High, would have matured so well?</p><p> </p><p>In fact, Noelle would be a mother before long.</p><p> </p><p>That meant Jill would be an aunt. She felt her tension ease as she smiled at the thought. <i>Aunt Jill. </i>What a wonderful--</p><p> </p><p>A sharp jab on her chin startled her. "Ouch!"</p><p> </p><p>"It's okay. Just relax," Sheena said. "You have a few blemishes here. We can take care of that right--"</p><p> </p><p>"I didn't come here to have my pimples treated." Noelle had warned Jill that the young masseuse tended to try to fix anything that wasn't just right. The young woman obviously had delusions of grandeur and saw herself becoming the makeover queen. Jill refused to be her first experiment.</p><p> </p><p>"I just want a nice, painless massage," Jill said. Actually, she hadn't even wanted that. "Jill Cooper," came a firm, commanding voice from another cubicle in the large, cedar-lined spa, "you agreed to do this. So do it."</p><p> </p><p>"I agreed to a massage, not to have my face poked and prodded like a--"</p><p> </p><p>"Settle down and let the girl do her job."</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, ma'am," Jill replied, then muttered under her breath, "Noelle needs to get these walls soundproofed."</p><p> </p><p>"What's that?" Edith Potts called again.</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing. Sorry. I'll be good. I'm having a <i>simply magnificent </i>time." Could Edith hear the sarcasm?</p><p> </p><p>"That's my girl."</p><p> </p><p>Nope. Edith had never understood the subtleties of irony. The lady simply said what she thought.</p><p> </p><p>Sheena returned to her massaging, distracted from her makeover project. "Will wonders never cease. Edith Potts must be the only person in town you can't boss around."</p><p> </p><p>Jill scowled up at her, and Sheena smiled back, wagging her blond eyebrows, which had been plucked to the point that she looked permanently surprised.</p><p> </p><p>The twit was right, of course. Jill would do anything for Edith. Eighty-three-year-old Edith Potts, retired principal of Hideaway High, could claim friendship with the majority of Hideaway's residents as well as a few of the flocks of tourists who escaped to this tiny lakeside village every year.</p><p> </p><p>To Jill, her elderly friend epitomized courage. Since Jill often felt as if she, herself, epitomized the exact opposite, she had always been drawn to Edith's independent, nurturing spirit. It was Edith who had found a school nurse position for Jill here in Hideaway when tragedy necessitated that Jill would have to return home and stay nearby for the family business.</p><p> </p><p>Once again closing her eyes, Jill tried to give herself over to the relaxation Sheena had promised. "This honey and almond cream smells heavenly."</p><p> </p><p>"It's our most popular. We mix it here ourselves."</p><p> </p><p>"I'd like a jar of that, if it's for sale." Still, if she came away with scars on her face from an over-eager masseuse, Jill would hold Edith and Noelle personally responsible.</p><p> </p><p>In spite of her intentions to remain vigilant, her muscles seemed to liquefy of their own volition. She could feel her body merging with the soft sheets on the massage table until she wasn't sure where the padding ended and her flesh began. Moreover, she didn't care.</p><p> </p><p>Jill seldom relaxed. She had been accused of being one of the most uptight, untouchable single women in Hideaway and the surrounding area. Most of the townsfolk made such comments out of her earshot--or so they thought--but Edith never hesitated to speak her mind, and neither did Noelle.</p><p> </p><p>As Jill thought about it, she had recently found herself blessed--if that could be the term for it--by associates at work who never minced words with her.</p><p> </p><p>They understood the term for her condition. Thanks to recent popular television shows, who didn't know what the letters OCD stood for? Yet they wouldn't let her get away with the typical behavior of someone with obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p> </p><p>Blessed...yes. That was it. She was truly blessed by people who loved her in spite--"Your brows could use a good plucking." Sheena's soft voice interrupted Jill's reverie.</p><p> </p><p>"What?" Jill opened her eyes to see the young woman hovering over her, wielding a pair of tweezers far too close. <i>Now </i>what tortures was she expected to endure for the sake of moral support?</p><p> </p><p>"I want to shape your eyebrows. I can take ten years off your face with a few good jerks."</p><p> </p><p>Jill's loose muscles suddenly tightened again. "Look, Sheena Marshall," she said, keeping her voice low in deference to Edith, "I didn't come here to be plucked or jerked or tweezed, I just came for a simple massage with this green stuff you smeared all over my face. Are you finished?"</p><p> </p><p>"Not yet. There are just so many things you need to have done. With your great bone structure--"</p><p> </p><p>"Shouldn't someone be tending to Edith?"</p><p> </p><p>"She knows how to relax, unlike you."</p><p> </p><p>"Where'd your mother go? I'd be perfectly willing to let her finish this massage so you can see to Edith." At least Mary would complete the job without trying to do a total makeover in the process.</p><p> </p><p>"She was only scheduled to work this morning," Sheena said, "and she wasn't too happy about having to do that."</p><p> </p><p>Sheena's mom, Mary Marshall, had reluctantly agreed to come to work at the spa on an as-needed basis until Noelle could determine for sure how many full-time staff members she would require.</p><p> </p><p>Not only was Mary an accomplished massage therapist who had worked for years in surrounding resorts, she was also a cosmetologist, with a good head for business.</p><p> </p><p>Sheena still lived at home, at the age of twenty-two, and seemed content to stay in Hideaway the rest of her life, living with her parents and working here at the spa. Jill felt for the girl, since she, too, had stayed home out of necessity for several years after graduating from high school.</p><p> </p><p>Sheena needed to get out of this place for a while and learn a little more about the world. Mary and Jed were keeping too tight a leash on her.</p><p> </p><p>Jill shifted on the massage table. "I think I heard Noelle come back from her errands a few minutes ago--can't she see to Edith while you're finishing here? I hate to think of Edith waiting over there all by herself."</p><p> </p><p>"I'll be...fine," Edith called to her.</p><p> </p><p>With a frown, Jill glanced at Sheena. Edith sounded less peaceful and relaxed than she had moments ago.</p><p> </p><p>"We won't be much longer," Sheena assured Jill. "Noelle warned me not to take too long the first time."</p><p> </p><p><i>First </i>time? Like this was going to happen again? What did Noelle need with moral support, anyway? Though the business was new, it was doing well.</p><p> </p><p>Was that laughter she heard in the next room?</p><p> </p><p>Jill gave a sigh, forcing herself to relax again. Edith had a sense of humor that had brought healing light to some of the darkest moments in Jill's life. Let her laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Yet even as Jill listened to that laughter, it didn't sound quite right....</p><p> </p><p>Sheena's movements slowed, as if she, too, noticed a change.</p><p> </p><p>That wasn't laughter. "Edith, you okay in there?" Jill asked. It sounded as if Edith was coughing.</p><p> </p><p>For several long seconds there was no answer, then came a muffled thump.</p><p> </p><p>Jill lunged up from the massage bed and scrambled out, stumbling against the tray table beside her. Bottles and jars crashed to the wooden floor. She swept past Sheena and raced into the hallway, then into the next cubicle, her loose gown billowing around her.</p><p> </p><p>She thrust the door open to find Edith lying on the floor, gnarled hands grasping her throat, eyes bulging with terror. Her face was still half covered with the mask of herbs, and her white hair tufted over the mask in sticky strands. The half of her face that was bare was nearly purple.</p><p> </p><p>"Call for help!" Jill dropped to her knees beside her friend and wiped the green mask of goo from her face with a towel. "Edith, it's okay. We're going to take care of you."</p><p> </p><p>The lady's fear-stricken gaze caught and held Jill's, begging for help. Her mouth worked silently.</p><p> </p><p>"Who do I call?" Sheena cried.</p><p> </p><p>"Get Noelle," Jill said, grasping Edith's hand. "I think she came back in. If not, call her on her cell. The clinic's closed today." In a more populated place, they would call 911. Here in Hideaway, that wasn't a good option.</p><p> </p><p>As Sheena rushed from the room, Edith's grasp tightened in Jill's. "S...c-cool," she rasped.</p><p> </p><p>"You're cool? I'll get a blanket for--"</p><p> </p><p>The hand tightened further. "N-no." She closed her eyes, and her grip weakened.</p><p> </p><p>"No. Edith! Stay with me. Help is on the way."</p><p> </p><p>Those eyes opened again. "S...cool..." Her voice barely reached Jill, and her mouth worked as if with great effort. "Re...cords...jet..."</p><p> </p><p>"Ed...</p></p><h2>Sean Donovan (The Californians, Book 3)</h2><p>Sean&#39;s heart goes out to his new bride, a fiercely independent woman whose past has hardened her.

For readers of English, it will be an authoritative survey of four centuries of Roman history, and a unique window on the German tradition of the last century.<br>Theodor Mommsen (d. 1903) was one of the greatest Roman historians of the nineteenth century, and the only one ever to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. His fame rests on his <em>History of Rome</em> as well as his work on Roman law and on the Roman provinces. But the work that would have concluded his history of Rome - which ran to the reign of Augustus - was never completed. This book represents that great lost work.<br>In 1980 Alexander Demandt discovered in an antiquarian bookshop a full and detailed handwritten transcript of the lectures on the Roman Empire, which Mommsen gave for many years from 1863 to 1886, made by two of his students. This transcript has been edited to provide the authoritative reconstruction of the book Mommsen never wrote, <em>A History of Rome Under the Emperors</em>.<br>Barbara and Alexander Demandt have carefully edited the text and provided detailed annotation and explanatory references. For the English edition, Professor Thomas Wiedemann has written an introduction which surveys Mommsen's position and influence in nineteenth century German scholarship and introduces his work for English speaking readers.</p><p>Theodor Mommsen&#39;s History of Rome, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902, was never completed. The manuscript of the fourth volume, the History of Rome under the Emperors, was burnt in a fire in Mommsen&#39;s house in 1880, and subsequently never published. Even though Mommsen lectured on the topic extensively from 1863 to 1886, it was believed that the lost volume could never be reconstructed. Alexander Demandt&#39;s discovery of complete and detailed transcripts by two of Mommsen&#39;s students finally gives us access to Mommsen&#39;s interpretation of the age of the emperors. Barbara and Alexander Demandt have carefully edited the text and provided detailed notes. For the English edition, Thomas Wiedemann has written an introduction which surveys Mommsen&#39;s position and influence in nineteenth century German scholarship and introduces his work to English-speaking readers.Alexander Demandt is a Full professor of Ancient History at the Free University, Berlin.

Vol. 5: The Struggle for Guadalcanal, August 1942-February 1943</h2><p>During the six months covered by volume five of Samuel Eliot Morison's magnificent history, the United States Navy fought six major engagements in waters surrounding Guadalcanal, more bitter and bloody than any naval battle in American history since 1814. From the Solomon Islands campaigns to the courageous action of Edson's Raiders at the Battle of the Bloody Ridge, from the great three-day Naval Battle of Guadalcanal to the Battle of Tassafaronga, Morison describes the events of these excruciating months in thrilling, heartbreaking detail from the shipdecks, cockpits, and exposed ridgetops where the fate of thousands of soldiers and sailors was decided. <p>"You may search the seven seas in vain for an ocean graveyard with the bones of so many ships and sailors as that body of water between Guadalcanal, Savo, and Florida Islands which our bluejackets named Ironbottom Sound," writes Morison. His account of the action is both harrowing and inspiring, an insider's tribute to those who made Guadalcanal the proving ground of their resourcefulness, tenacity, and courage.</p></p><p>&#34; &#39;For us who were there, or whose friends were there,&#39; says Captain Morison in conclusion, &#39;Guadalcanal is not a name but an emotion.&#39; To this one must say amen, while noting that emotion has not impeded the production of a fine volume on the bitterest and most complicated six months&#39; fighting of the Pacific war.&#34; -- American Historical Review &#34; Magnificently told.&#34; -- San Francisco Chronicle &#34; Morison&#39;s clear narrative of complex and confused battles could hardly be bettered.&#34; -- Times Literary Supplement &#34; Terse, sinewy, meticulous, and sweeping.

He has lived grandly and ferociously-and much beyond his means. His close friend Chick has suggested that he put forth a book of his convictions about the ideas which sustain humankind, or kill it, and much to Ravelstein's own surprise, he does and becomes a millionaire. Ravelstein suggests in turn that Chick write a memoir or a life of him, and during the course of a celebratory trip to Paris the two share thoughts on mortality, philosophy and history, loves and friends, old and new, and vaudeville routines from the remote past. The mood turns more somber once they have returned to the Midwest and Ravelstein succumbs to AIDS and Chick himself nearly dies.<br><br>Deeply insightful and always moving, Saul Bellow's new novel is a journey through love and memory. It is brave, dark, and bleakly funny: an elegy to friendship and to lives well (or badly) lived.</p><p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Saul Bellow confined himself to shorter fictions. Not that this old master ever dabbled in minimalism: novellas such as <i>The Actual</i> and <i>The Bellarosa Connection</i> are bursting at the seams with wit, plot, and the intellectual equivalent of high fiber. Still, Bellow's readers wondered if he would ever pull another full-sized novel from his hat. With <i>Ravelstein</i>, the author has done just that--and he proves that even in his ninth decade, he can pin a character to the page more vividly, and more permanently, than just about anybody on the planet.<p> Character is very much the issue in <i>Ravelstein</i>, whose eponymous subject is a thinly disguised version of Bellow's boon companion, the late Allan Bloom. Like Bloom, Abe Ravelstein has spent much of his career at the University of Chicago, fighting a rearguard action against the creeping boobism and vulgarity of American life. What's more, he's written a surprise bestseller (a ringer, of course, for <i>The Closing of the American Mind</i>), which has made him into a millionaire. And finally, he's dying--has died of AIDS, in fact, six years before the opening of the novel. What we're reading, then, is a faux memoir by his best friend and anointed Boswell, a Bellovian body-double named Chick: </p><blockquote> Ravelstein was willing to lay it all out for me. Now why did he bother to tell me such things, this large Jewish man from Dayton, Ohio? Because it very urgently needed to be said. He was HIV-positive, he was dying of complications from it. Weakened, he became the host of an endless list of infections. Still, he insisted on telling me over and over again what love was--the neediness, the awareness of incompleteness, the longing for wholeness, and how the pains of Eros were joined to the most ecstatic pleasures. </blockquote> <i>Ravelstein</i> is a little thin in the plot department--or more accurately, it has an anti-plot, which consists of Chick's inability to write his memoir. But seldom has a case of writer's block been so supremely productive. The narrator dredges up anecdote after anecdote about his subject, assembling a composite portrait: "In approaching a man like Ravelstein, a piecemeal method is perhaps best." We see this <i>very</i> worldly philosopher teaching, kvetching, eating, drinking, and dying, the last in melancholic increments. His death, and Chick's own brush with what Henry James called "the distinguished thing," give much of the novel a kind of black-crepe coloration. But fortunately, Bellow shares Ravelstein's "Nietzschean view, favorable to comedy and bandstands," and there can't be many eulogies as funny as this one. <p> As always, the author is lavish with physical detail, bringing not only his star but a large gallery of minor players to rude and resounding life ("Rahkmiel was a non-benevolent Santa Claus, a dangerous person, ruddy, with a red-eyed scowl and a face in which the anger muscles were highly developed"). His sympathies are also stretched in some interesting directions by his homosexual protagonist. Bellow hasn't, to be sure, transformed himself into an affirmative-action novelist. But his famously capacious view of human nature has been enriched by this additional wrinkle: "In art you become familiar with due process. You can't simply write people off or send them to hell." A world-class portrait, a piercing intimation of mortality, <i>Ravelstein</i> is truly that <i>other</i> distinguished thing: a great novel. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>Our 'greatest living novelist' [Jonathan Yardley, The Washington Post] returns with his first full-length novel in years. <p> "Simply the best writer we have" </p><p> -The New York Times Book Review </p><p> "No contemporary of ours is more consistently brilliant and more defiantly risky than Saul Bellow" </p><p> - Joyce Carol Oates, The New York Times Book Review </p><p> "His voice has the meticulous range and certainty of a cathedral choir.

Dale Jacquette&#39;s lively and incisive biography charts Frege&#39;s life from its beginnings in small-town north Germany, through his student days in Jena, to his development as an enduringly influential thinker. Along the way Jacquette considers Frege&#39;s ground-breaking Begriffschrift (1879), in which he formulated his &#39;ideal logical language&#39;, his magisterial Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (1893 and 1903), and his complex relation to thinkers including Husserl and especially Russell, whose Paradox had such drastic implications for Frege&#39;s logicism. Jacquette concludes with a thoughtful assessment of Frege&#39;s legacy.

CALCULUS: CONCEPTS AND CONTEXTS is highly regarded because it has successfully brought peace to departments that were split between reform and traditional approaches to teaching calculus.

On the shores of Lake Minnetonka in Minneapolis, three men created Mound Metalcraft in an old schoolhouse in the late 1940s and set out to make tie racks and garden utensils. Sales weren't as abundant as expected, so the group decided to produce sturdy construction toys crafted from the leftover materials. Tonka - named after the nearby lake - was born and the company changed the face of the toy industry forever.Tonka takes you through the early days of the company, to its purchase by Hasbro in 1991. Through the years, there were many ups and downs, but a few things remained constant: the rugged quality, realism, and durability of the toys. The employees were an integral part of the company, and profiles of a handful of former employees help bring a personal level to the story of the company that drove its way to the top of the toy truck industry. Each epoch of Tonka history is covered and accompanied by 150 color and 25 archival images.The Tonka story itself is one of an incredible journey. From the humble confines of a small schoolhouse, to a giant corporation that sold toys everywhere, Tonka remains a household word for strength and durability and is synonymous with toys that could withstand anything a child could do with them.br&gt;Author bio:Dennis David is an automobile journalist and writes for many antique car enthusiast magazines.

Forster arrived in Alexandria, full of lofty ideals as a volunteer for the Red Cross. Yet most of his time was spent exploring &#34;the magic, antiquity and complexity&#34; of the place in order to cope with living in what he saw as a &#34;funk-hole&#34;. With a novelist&#39;s pen, he brings to life the fabled, romantic city of Alexander the Great, capital of Graeco-Roman Egypt, beacon of light and culture symbolised by the Pharos, where the doomed love affair of Antony and Cleopatra was played out and the greatest library the world has ever known was built. Threading 3,000 years of history with vibrant strands of literature and punctuating the narrative with his own experiences, Forster immortalised Alexandria, painting an incomparable portrait of the great city and, inadvertently, himself.</p><p>E.M. Forster (1879-1970) was perhaps the most quintessential of English novelists. From the stifling drawing rooms of Howard&#39;s End to the dust and dark undercurrents of Passage to India, he captured the spirit of his time in a way that has made his six novels unforgettable and much-loved classics.</p><h2>Penn State Altoona (Campus History)</h2><p>Founded in 1939, Penn State Altoona began its life as the Altoona Undergraduate Center, owing its genesis to an inspired group of local citizens who built, financed, and nurtured the college through the economic woes of the Great Depression, an enrollment collapse engendered by World War II, and the rise and fall of the region&#39;s railroad fortunes.

This new edition has been thoroughly updated to cover all developments since the last edition, reflecting the region's growing popularity for holiday homes and as a busy conference destination at the heart of Italy, plus its appeal for wildlife and active tourism, including trekking, family holidays and horse-riding. Abruzzo offers the best of undiscovered Italy from pristine beaches to mountain glaciers, with some of Italy's most beautiful medieval villages clinging to the hillsides in between. This brand new edition of Bradt's <em>Abruzzo</em> provides all the practical and background information you'll need to explore this surprising region.What makes the Abruzzo region remarkable is that it is still about as unique and authentic an Italian experience as you can get in a country so devoured by international tourism. Abruzzo offers one of the most beautiful coastlines in the country, only a short distance from the tallest mountain ranges in Italy outside the Alps (it is the second most popular skiing centre in Italy outside the Alps) and one of the best places for hiking and flora/fauna spotting. What's more, despite the economic downturn of recent times, the regional government continues to invest in a &#x2018;beautification' project for its major urban centres and in the development of its regional highlights such as mountains, wildlife parks and rural towns. It's notable that in the 2017 national competition for &#x2018;I Borghi Pi� Belli d'Italia' (The Most Beautiful Towns in Italy) programme, Abruzzo was recognised as having 23 of the country's most beautiful towns, trailing second only behind Umbria and with at least a handful more than Tuscany. Intriguingly, Madonna's family hails from the town of Pacentro, to which the singer donated US$500,000 for restoration works after the 2009 earthquake in the region. Blue Flag beaches, mountain hiking and where to spot rare wildlife such as bears and wolves are all covered, as are untouched castles and frescoed churches and the region's plethora of Roman ruins. Italian cooking and the best places to eat are featured (Abruzzo is home to the majority of Italy's domestic pasta production), and there is extensive coverage of culture and language (Abruzzo is one of Italy's most linguistically diverse regions). Written with warmth and insight by a native Abruzzese, Bradt's <em>Abruzzo</em> contains all the information you need to discover this enchanting part of Italy.<br><br></p><p>Luciano Di Gregorio is a teacher of English and Linguistics as well as a freelance travel writer and journalist.

It is a story of passionate love, travail, and final triumph. Orphaned at an early age, Jane Eyre leads a lonely life until she finds work as a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets the mysterious Mr. Rochester and sees a ghostly woman who roams the halls by night. The relationship between the heroine and Mr. Rochester is only one episode, albeit the most important, in a detailed fictional autobiography in which the author transmuted her own experience into high art. In this work, the plucky heroine is outwardly of plain appearance but possesses an indomitable spirit, a sharp wit, and great courage.

Introduced by the American physicist Richard Feynman (1918-88) soon after World War II as a means of simplifying lengthy calculations in quantum electrodynamics, they soon gained adherents in many branches of the discipline. Yet as new physicists adopted the tiny line drawings, they also adapted the diagrams and introduced their own interpretations. <i>Drawing Theories Apart</i> traces how generations of young theorists learned to frame their research in terms of the diagrams&#x2014;and how both the diagrams and their users were molded in the process.<br> <br> Drawing on rich archival materials, interviews, and more than five hundred scientific articles from the period, <i>Drawing Theories Apart</i> uses the Feynman diagrams as a means to explore the development of American postwar physics. By focusing on the ways young physicists learned new calculational skills, David Kaiser frames his story around the crafting and stabilizing of the basic tools in the physicist's kit&#x2014;thus offering the first book to follow the diagrams once they left Feynman's hands and entered the physics vernacular.<br></p></p><p><b>David Kaiser</b> is associate professor in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society and lecturer in the Department of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. <br>"A colorful and readable account of the earliest applications of the diagrammatic technique." (Eugen Merzbacher <i>Physics Today</i> 2006-11-01)<br><br>"This is a rich and original contribution to the expanding historical scholarship on the development of scientific tools and practices. Kaiser is one of the few historians to deal with the conceptual equipment of science as a kind of malleable paper tool, showing how Feynman diagrams were refracted through local environments and ultimately transformed. In all, a dazzling piece of work."-Daniel J. Kevles, Yale University<br> (Daniel J. Kevles, Yale University)<br><br>&#x201c;Only a few people have the talent to write the history of theoretical physics. Only one or two can conceptualize and explain the elaboration of theory as a practical activity, which, like fine art, has its own competing traditions and conventions of representation.&nbsp; David Kaiser accomplishes all this and backs it up with a level of detailed scholarship that makes it totally convincing.&#x201d; (Harry Collins, Cardiff University)<br><br>&#x201c;This book is a double delight. It is the best example so far of a new way of doing the history of science, not as an account of evolving theories, experiments, and instruments, but of diagrams. It is a story of how a generation of physicists came to think for themselves and to talk to others in a new way. It takes you inside their minds and their seminars. It is also a wonderful way to learn how Feynman diagrams work and what they mean&#x2014;in effect, a super do-it-yourself manual.&#x201d; (Ian Hacking, Coll�ge de France, Paris)<br><br>"This is surely the definitive study of one of the great ubiquitous tools of modern quantum field theory." (A. I. Solomon <i>Contemporary Physics</i> 2006-01-01)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Intellectual tools can have profound impacts. Feynman diagrams have greatly improved how theoretical physicists think and, consequently, our understanding of nature. <i>Drawing Theories Apart</i> provides an informative description of how their influence came about.&#x201d;</p> (Gordon Kane <i>Science</i>)<br><br>"This is a fascinating book., if you are interested in the history, sociology and people of physics. It should be in every physics library." (Bruce H.J. McKellar <i>Australian Physics</i>)<br><br>"Kaiser is prodigiously talented in telling the adventure of modern theoretical physics: the richness of the book may impress even the most demanding historians and physicists. Physicists will probably be surprised to learn of so many varieties of Feynman diagrams. Historians will be delighted with the originality of the approach. . . . Everybody will be enchanted by the style of the book: even when (very) difficult physics is presented, it is never boring; it is always luminous and exciting." (Anouk Barberousse <i>International Studies in the Philsophy of Science</i>)<br><br>2006 book prize (<i>Forum for the History of Science in America</i>)<br><br>"A colorful and readable account of the earliest applications of the diagrammatic technique. . . .

(Eugen Merzbacher <i>Physics</i>)</p><h2>Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent</h2><p>This biography describes the intellectual and political milieus that helped shape Noam Chomsky, a pivotal figure in contemporary linguistics, politics, cognitive psychology, and philosophy. It also presents an engaging political history of the last several decades, including such events as the Spanish Civil War, the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the march on the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam War. The book highlights Chomsky&#39;s views on the uses and misuses of the university as an institution, his assessment of useful political engagement, and his doubts about postmodernism. Because Chomsky is given ample space to articulate his views on many of the major issues relating to his work, both linguistic and political, this book reads like the autobiography that Chomsky says he will never write.Barsky&#39;s account reveals the remarkable consistency in Chomsky&#39;s interests and principles over the course of his life. The book contains well-placed excerpts from Chomsky&#39;s published writings and unpublished correspondence, including the author&#39;s own years-long correspondence with Chomsky.*Not for sale in Canada</p><p>Inspired by the works and the milieus of Noam Chomsky, Robert Barsky works at the intersection of literature, law and language theory, where he explores, among other issues, the challenges faced by vulnerable peoples including refugees, homeless people and undocumented migrants. He is currently working on a book about the radical Zionist organization Avukah, and he is completing a project that reviews canonical works from the Great Tradition through the perspective of vulnerable migrants.He is the author of <i>Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent</i>, <i>The Chomsky Effect: A Radical Works Beyond the Ivory Tower</i>, and <i>Zellig Harris: From American Linguistics to Socialist Zionism</i>, all three published by the MIT Press.I found Robert Barsky's biography of Noam chomsky a comprehensive and compelling account of the scientific achievements and political engagements of one of this century's foremost intellectuals and social activists. Barsky convincingly demonstrates that independence of mind, freedom of spirit, and a passionate will to overcome social injustice, are the defining characteristics of Chomsky's fully-engaged life. This study will help a new generation of intellectuals to take up the unfinished business of this era&#x2015;the construction of a meaningful democracy. It will serve also to raise those who are now weary and dispirited out of their lethargy. Barsky, with Chomsky as his subject and model, has written a text of hope.&#x2015;Herbet I. Schiller, author of Culture Inc. and Information Inequality; Professor Emeritus of Communication, University of California (<i>Endorsement</i>)<br><br>A charming account of the genesis of Chomsky's innovations in linguistics, and his critique of the status quo. Barsky has chronicled the development of Chomsky's advocacy: ideas ranging from workplace democracy to the worth of every person as a contributor to reshaping society.&#x2015;Seymour Melman, Professor Emeritus, Industrial Engineering, Columbia University (<i>Endorsement</i>)<br><br>For those who are interested in Noam Chomsky's work and its deepest roots, Barsky's book is essential reading. With its wealth of authenticated information (much of it unavailable or not readily available, including many photographs), it sheds much light on the thought and action of 'arguably the most important intellectual alive (ans unarguably the most cited). It provides an unparalleled point of entry and privileged access to a life committed to the struggle for a better world as well as to the thinking of one of the most remarkable figures of modern history. It may also be read as a challenging guide to a little known but far from unimportant strain of post-Enlightenment intellectual history and its significance for the immediate future.&#x2015;Carlos Otero, Professor of Romance Linguistics, UCLA; Editor of N. Chomsky's Language and Politics and Noam Chomsky: Critical Assessments (<i>Endorsement</i>)<br><br>Robert F. Barsky's wonderul new biography fits a real gap in the exisiting literature on Chomsky, one of the most remarkable figures of century. He has produced a tightly-written, engaging, thorough, and remarkably accessible account of Chomsky and his times&#x2015;intellectual and otherwise. Barsky has an unenviable task: make both Chomsky's contributions to linguistic theory and the main elements of his political worldview clear to general readers without turning these discussions into a comic book style 'Chomsky for Beginners.' I think he does a great job. Barsky's careful reconstruction of the early political-intellectual milieu and influences on Chomsky is extremely useful. At the same time, he covers most of the events and issues that Chomsky's friends consider central to the 1960s and 1970s. I would not hesitate to use this text in a classroom or to recommend it to others.&#x2015;Robert Vitalis, Professor of Government, Clark College (<i>Endorsement</i>)<br><br>... a remarkably comprehensive biography.... Barsky makes Chomsky the person more visible than ever before.&#x2015;Michael G. Wessells, Contemporary Psychology (<i>Endorsement</i>)<br><br>[A] detailed and perceptive survey of Chomsky's life and work.&#x2015;Raphael Salkie, Times Higher Education Supplement (<i>Endorsement</i>)<br><br>For over thirty years Noam Chomsky has been a pathbreaking linguist and a controversial critic of American policies and politics. Indeed, the world seems to divide between those who revere and those who revile Chomsky. Both groups would find valuable Robert F. Barsky's appreciative biography; he recounts (the known and the little known) facts of Chomsky's life, evaluates his linguistic contribution and surveys the main quarrels. This is an essential book not only for Chomsky affecionados and adversaries, but for all students of American political and intellectual life.&#x2015;Russell Jacoby, UCLA (<i>Endorsement</i>)</p><h2>Cherokee Indian Nation: A Troubled History</h2><p>Traces the history of the Cherokee tribe, clarifies misconceptions about their life and culture, and examines the problems they face today</p><p>This important book explores the truth behind the legends, offering new insights into the turbulent history of these Native Americans.

Writing in a great variety of musical forms--symphonies, concertos, operas, vocal music, and chamber music--he infused his works with poetic lyricism and gave tonal language and forms new vitality. His rich legacy includes such famous compositions as the <em>Adagio for Strings</em>, the orchestral song <em>Knoxville: Summer of 1915</em>, three concertos, and his two operas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Vanessa</em> and <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>, a commissioned work that opened the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center. Generously documented by letters, sketchbooks, original musical manuscripts, and interviews with friends, colleagues and performers with whom he worked, this is the first book to cover Barber's entire career and all of his compositions. The biographical material on Barber is closely interspersed with a discussion of his music, displaying Barber's creative processes at work from his early student compositions to his mature masterpieces. Heyman also provides the social context in which this major composer grew: his education, how he built his career, the evolving musical tastes of American audiences, his relationship to musical giants like Serge Koussevitzky, and the role of radio in the promotion of his music. A testament to the significance of the new Romanticism, <em>Samuel Barber</em> stands as a model biography of an important American musical figure.<br></p><p><br>Barbara B. Heyman, a pianist, editor, and musicologist, has written and lectured extensively on Samuel Barber.

The breadth of Edwards's expertise is demonstrated in the first entry, "The Mystery of Chenholt," by Alice and Claude Askew from <i>The Adventures of Police Constable Vane M.A., on Duty and off</i>, a 1908 volume so rare that even the British Library lacks a copy. This clever tale establishes atmosphere and characterizations in just a few pages, as a constable named Reggie is dispatched to the quiet Surrey countryside to recover from a traumatic night in "the mummy house," only to be called upon by a butler desperate to save his employer's wife from her husband, whom he believes is poisoning her. Also notable are Christianna Brand's ingenious "After the Event," in which her series sleuth, Inspector Cockrill, investigates a murder during a production of Othello, and Freeman Wills Crofts's inverted mystery, "Fingerprints."

For more than three years, Ai Weiwei turned out a steady stream of scathing social commentary, criticism of government policy, thoughts on art and architecture, and autobiographical writings. He wrote about the Sichuan earthquake (and posted a list of the schoolchildren who died because of the government's &#x201c;tofu-dregs engineering&#x201d;), reminisced about Andy Warhol and the East Village art scene, described the irony of being investigated for &#x201c;fraud&#x201d; by the Ministry of Public Security, made a modest proposal for tax collection. Then, on June 1, 2009, Chinese authorities shut down the blog. This book offers a collection of Ai's notorious online writings translated into English&#x2015;the most complete, public documentation of the original Chinese blog available in any language.</p><p>The New York Times called Ai &#x201c;a figure of Warholian celebrity.&#x201d; He is a leading figure on the international art scene, a regular in museums and biennials, but in China he is a manifold and controversial presence: artist, architect, curator, social critic, justice-seeker. He was a consultant on the design of the famous &#x201c;Bird's Nest&#x201d; stadium but called for an Olympic boycott; he received a Chinese Contemporary Art &#x201c;lifetime achievement award&#x201d; in 2008 but was beaten by the police in connection with his &#x201c;citizen investigation&#x201d; of earthquake casualties in 2009. <i>Ai Weiwei's Blog </i>documents Ai's passion, his genius, his hubris, his righteous anger, and his vision for China. </p></p><p>Ai Weiwei is one of today's most important and controversial artists. His recent exhibitions include &#x201c;Sunflower Seeds&#x201d; at the Tate Modern, London, a vast assemblage of handcrafted porcelain sunflower seeds; and six fiberglass dioramas depicting his 81-day imprisonment in 2011, shown at a Venice gallery in parallel with the 2013 Venice Biennale. He was a designer of the famous &#x201c;Bird's Nest&#x201d; stadium of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.<p>Ai Weiwei is a widely acclaimed artist, an innovative designer, an influential architect, a visionary urbanist, a competitive cook, and even a great hairdresser. He is also a compelling and disputatious writer who knows how to address and to rally a wide audience, voicing his own dissatisfaction, and that of his fellow countrymen, at being confronted on a daily basis with the alarming glibness of a rampant Chinese society and its disquieting political representation.</p>&#x2015;<b>Chris Dercon</b>, Director, Tate Modern<br><br><p>Blogging produces reality rather than simply representing it.

His father, Nikolai, gladly receives the two young men at his estate, called Maryino, but Nikolai's brother, Pavel, soon becomes upset by the strange new philosophy called "nihilism" which the young men advocate.</p><p>FATHERS AND SONS was the most closely studied of Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev's works in the Soviet high school curriculum. The novel seemed a perfect vehicle for portraying the brewing unrest of the pre-revolutionary era, and introduced the character of Bazarov -- the spirited nihilist who was seen as a brilliant idealistic rebel, the new kind of perfect man who rejected the old notions of class and came to disrupt nobility's status quo. Growing up, Turgenev witnessed much class injustice in Russia, and his themes reflect his overwhelming concern with the suffering of the poor and the voiceless serfs. But FATHERS AND SONS is not merely a convenient socio-political piece; Turgenev is a lyrical romantic. At the novel's heart lies the ultimately tragic human story of Bazarov's flippant kiss of a servant girl and the bizarre tension it causes in a cozy country gentry household where he is a guest.</p></p><p>When &#34;Fathers and Sons was first published in Russia, in 1862, it was met with a blaze of controversy about where Turgenev stood in relation to his account of generational misunderstanding. Was he criticizing the worldview of the conservative aesthete, Pavel Kirsanov, and the older generation, or that of the radical, cerebral medical student, Evgenii Bazarov, representing the younger one? The critic Dmitrii Pisarev wrote at the time that the novel &#34;stirs the mind . . . because everything is permeated with the most complete and most touching sincerity.&#34; N. N. Strakhov, a close friend of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, praised its &#34;profound vitality.&#34; It is this profound vitality in Turgenev&#39;s characters that carry his novel of ideas to its rightful place as a work of art and as one of the classics of Russian Literature.Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev (1818 - 1883) was a Russian novelist, short story writer, poet, playwright, translator and popularizer of Russian literature in the West. His first major publication, a short story collection entitled A Sportsman&#39;s Sketches (1852), was a milestone of Russian realism and his novel Fathers and Sons (1862) is regarded as one of the major works of 19th-century fiction. Turgenev&#39;s artistic purity made him a favorite of like-minded novelists of the next generation, such as Henry James and Joseph Conrad, both of whom greatly preferred Turgenev to Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. James, who wrote no fewer than five critical essays on Turgenev&#39;s work, claimed that &#34;his merit of form is of the first order&#34; (1873) and praised his &#34;exquisite delicacy&#34;, which &#34;makes too many of his rivals appear to hold us, in comparison, by violent means and introduce us, in comparison, to vulgar things&#34; (1896). Vladimir Nabokov, notorious for his casual dismissal of many great writers, praised Turgenev&#39;s &#34;plastic musical flowing prose&#34;, but criticized his &#34;labored epilogues&#34; and &#34;banal handling of plots&#34;. Nabokov stated that Turgenev &#34;is not a great writer, though a pleasant one&#34; and ranked him fourth among nineteenth-century Russian prose writers, behind Tolstoy, Gogol and Anton Chekhov, but ahead of Dostoyevsky. His idealistic ideas about love, specifically the devotion a wife should show her husband, were cynically referred to by characters in Chekhov&#39;s &#34;An Anonymous Story&#34;.</p><h2>Film Comedy</h2><p>What exactly is film comedy and what is the basis for its widespread appeal? <i>Film Comedy</i> uses formal, socio-historical and industrial perspectives to answer this question.

What is the relationship between comedy and narrative, from early silent slapstick to the performance of actors such as Steve Martin and Jim Carrey? How has romantic comedy changed, or remained the same, from the 1930s to today? What happens when comedy is put to more serious ends in satire ranging from works produced under communism in Eastern Europe and Cuba to Hollywood features such as <i>Bullworth</i> and <i>Wag the Dog</i>?

Dale F. Lott, a distinguished behavioral ecologist who was born on the National Bison Range and has studied the buffalo for many years, relates what is known about this iconic animal's life in the wild and its troubled history with humans. Written with unusual grace and verve, <i>American Bison </i>takes us on a journey into the bison's past and shares a compelling vision for its future, offering along the way a valuable introduction to North American prairie ecology. <br><br>We become Lott's companions in the field as he acquaints us with the social life and physiology of the bison, sharing stories about its impressive physical prowess and fascinating relationships. Describing the entire grassland community in which the bison live, he writes about the wolves, pronghorn, prairie dogs, grizzly bears, and other animals and plants, detailing the interdependent relationships among these inhabitants of a lost landscape. Lott also traces the long and dramatic relationship between the bison and Native Americans, and gives a surprising look at the history of the hide hunts that delivered the coup de gr�ce to the already dwindling bison population in a few short years. <br><br>This book gives us a peek at the rich and unique ways of life that evolved in the heart of America. Lott also dismantles many of the myths we have created about these ways of life, and about the bison in particular, to reveal the animal itself: ruminating, reproducing, and rutting in its full glory. His portrait of the bison ultimately becomes a plea to conserve its wildness and an eloquent meditation on the importance of the wild in our lives.</p><p>"This is the best book I've read about American bison and their habitat. It is vivid, concise, witty, erudite, first-hand, and up-to-date. Most important, it argues convincingly that the only way to assure survival of bison and their habitat in the wild is to establish a Great Plains National Park at least 5,000 square miles in extent."&#x2015;David Rains Wallace, author of <i>The Bonehunter's Revenge: Dinosaurs, Greed, and the Great Scientific Feud of the Gilded Age</i> <br><br>"Dr. Lott's scholarship is strong and thorough. <i>American Bison</i> presents an extensive, state-of-the-art review of key points of American bison that are unaddressed or under-addressed by previous books.

Life above 13,000 feet in northern Dolpo&#x2015;often called the last paradise because of its breathtaking snow-capped peaks, untouched beauty, and hand-irrigated green pastures&#x2015;was one of constant risk and harsh survival. In the 1980s, Dolpo had no running water, electricity, motor vehicles, phones, school, or doctors, other than the local lamas, trained in the use of herbs and prayer. <br><br>Dorje Dolma's life centered around the care of her numerous younger brothers and sisters and the family's sheep, goats, and yaks. At age five she began herding and was soon taking the animals high in the mountains, where she fought off predatory wolves and snow leopards. Covering her first ten years, the story takes Dorje from her primitive mountain village to the bewildering city of Kathmandu, and finally to a new home in America, where she receives life-saving surgery.<br><br>With humor, soul, and insightful detail, the author gives us vividly told vignettes of daily life and the practice of centuries-old Tibetan traditions. She details the heartbreaking trials, natural splendors, and familial joys of growing up in this mysterious, faraway part of the world with its vanishing culture. The sharp increase in recent years of western trekkers to the area, and the introduction of modern communication and transportation, is causing rapid change in Dolpo. This wonderful and surprising tale of survival, loss, and self-reflection offers us entry to this difficult, yet magical, place. <br>Above all, this is the inspiring story of an indomitable spirit conquering all obstacles, a tale of a girl with a disability on her way to becoming a dynamic woman in a new world.</p><p>Dorje Dolma was born in the remote Dolpo region of Nepal, high in the mountains bordering Tibet. She was the oldest of eleven children, only six of whom survived the harsh conditions of their lives. Dolpo had no running water, electricity, motor vehicles, phones, school, or doctors, other than the local lamas, trained in the use of herbs and prayer. Dorje began herding the family's goats and sheep at age five and by seven she was defending them from attacks by wolves and snow leopards.<br><br> When she was ten, Dorje's parents took her on a month-long trek to Kathmandu to find help for a serious health problem she had. There they encountered Westerners who arranged to bring Dorje to the United States and get her the surgery she needed to save her life.<br><br>Adopted by her new American family, Dorje eventually graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in Fine Arts. She now works as an early childhood teacher in Boulder, Colorado, and continues to develop her art. This is her first book.Yak Girl: Growing Up in the Remote Dolpo Region of Nepal is a vivid testimony of growing up and learning to survive in a harsh, rugged, yet astonishingly beautiful land. Her story includes a long and sometimes perilous journey, since her parents took her on a month-long trek to Kathmandu at age ten, followed by a meeting with westerners and travel to the United States for surgery to save her from a life-threatening condition. A candid, true-life story of hardship, strength, family ties, and culture shock, Yak Girl is highly recommended.

Between 1968 and 1980, this new regime, headed by the Arab Baath Socialist party, used ruthless repression and relentless organization to transform the way Iraqis think and react to political questions. In just twelve years, a party of a few thousand people grew to include nearly ten percent of the Iraqi population.<br><br>This book describes the experience of Baathism from 1968 to 1980 and analyzes the kind of political authority it engendered, culminating in the personality cult around Saddam Hussein. Fear, the author argues, is at the heart of Baathi politics and has become the cement for a genuine authority, however bizarre.<br><br>Examining Iraqi history in a search for clues to understanding contemporary political affairs, the author illustrates how the quality of Baathi pan-Arabism as an ideology, the centrality of the first experience of pan-Arabism in Iraq, and the interaction between the Baath and communist parties in Iraq from 1958 to 1968 were crucial in shaping the current regime.<br><br>Saddam Hussein's decision to launch all-out war against Iran in September 1980 marked the end of the first phase of this reshaping of modern Iraqi politics. The Iraq-Iran war is a momentous event in its own right, but for Iraq, the author argues, the war diverts dissent against the Baathi regime by focusing attention on the specter of an enemy beyond Iraq's borders, thus masking a hidden potential for even greater violence inside Iraq.</p><p>Originally written under the pseudonym Samir al-Khalil and published before the Gulf War, <i>Republic of Fear</i> describes the rise of Saddam Hussein and the Arab Ba'th Socialist party. The author, an Iraqi expatriate now living in the United States, offers this updated edition under his real name, Kanan Makiya. A new introduction discusses events following the invasion of Kuwait ("the chamber of horrors that is Saddam Hussein's Iraq has grown into something that not even the most morbid imagination could have dreamed up"). The book is not merely a chronicle of recent Iraqi politics, but a discussion of why the country has evolved into "a Kafkaesque world ... one ruled and held together by fear." Essential reading for anybody who wants to understand modern Iraq. <i>--John J. Miller</i><b>Kanan Makiya</b>'s books include <i>The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq </i>(California, 1991), <i>Cruelty and Silence: War, Tyranny, Uprising, and the Arab World </i>(1993), and <i>The Rock: A Seventh Century Tale of Jerusalem </i>(2002).</p><h2>The Practical Anarchist: Writings of Josiah Warren (American Philosophy)</h2><p><p>The Practical Anarchist brings to light the work of Josiah Warren, eccentric American genius. Devoting his life to showing the practicality of an astonishing ideal, Warren devoted equal industry to the question of how to make a pair of shoes and how to remake the social world into an individualist paradise.</p><p>This will be the first chance for many readers to encounter Warren&#x2019;s writings, and in many cases their first publication since their original appearance in obscure, self-published periodicals, including The Peaceful Revolutionist (1833), the first American anarchist periodical. Moreover, they often appeared in a bizarre experimental typography.</p><p>This volume presents, out of the welter of bewildering writings left by Warren, a reading text designed for today&#x2019; readers and students. It seeks to convey the practical value of many of Warren&#x2019;s ideas, their continuing relevance.</p></p><p>Crispin Sartwell teaches philosophy and political science at Dickinson College. He is the author of numerous books, most recently <i>Against the State: An Introduction to Anarchist Political Theory</i>.Crispin Sartwell's work makes a timely contribution, particularly given the recent economic crisis that has shaken many people's faith in the certainty of market systems. It is often believed that these economic systems have gone unchallenged from the origins of the country. Josiah Warren&#x2019;s ideas remind us that thoughtful individuals can devise new approaches to economic issues. (&#x2015;Maurice Hamington <i>Metropolitan State College of Denver</i>)<br><br><p>Sartwell does an outstanding job situating Warren's work within the<br>history of anarchist thought and within the history of American anarchism<br>in particular.</p> (&#x2015;Kenneth Stikkers <i>Southern Illinois University</i>)<br><br>. . .

Readers will feel the connection." --Vickie Barr, Director, HEATH Resource Center (National Clearinghouse on Postsecondary Education for Individuals with Disabilities) </p><p>"High school and college students preparing for a career, graduates entering the work force, and adults hoping to change careers will find Learning a Living an invaluable resource.

All of us have the right to choose our friends and associates. And although your disabilities are challenging, you can always try to improve' (p. 21). The focus of this book is learning to improve where possible, knowing about choices and making good ones, and asking for help when necessary. Although written for those with LD, ADHD, and dyslexia, it offers advice and guidance of value to any young person approaching adult life and the world of work. </p><p>Importantly, the author begins with high school and a chapter filled with suggestions to help students begin thinking of their futures while making the best use of their high school years. She tells about services available, using the IEP, what to do if there is no IEP, and how to ask for accommodations. She emphasizes transition planning. </p><p>She then offers suggestions for trade school, college, and graduate school, stressing the point that many people return to school and earn degrees in later life. In writing about accommodations, she presents a challenge such as, 'You have difficulty with the mental and conceptual act of writing,' then lists responses that are activities for the individual to carry out to circumvent the challenge and to work to improve it. </p><p>She has chapters on social skills, believing in yourself, and searching for information about jobs. She provides suggestions about how to interact on paper, on the phone, and in person. Ideas are offered for managing interviews. </p><p>Suggestions are made for seeking help from career counselors and vocational rehabilitation. She tells of volunteer jobs, internships, and part-time jobs especially as preparation for full-time work. </p><p>She includes a chapter about The Americans with Disabilities Act and what this means to persons with ADHD, LD, or dyslexia. She discusses accommodations that are realistic and those that are not. She gives examples of how to ask for accommodations, and what to do with various kinds of rejecting comments. </p><p>The book is well designed. It is large, 8 1/2 x 11 inches. The print is relatively large. Headings are clear bold type. Important points are set off by numbers or bullets. Especially noteworthy ideas are enclosed in gray boxes. An excellent table of contents guides the reader exactly to the section of the text in which they are interested. </p><p>Throughout the book the author stresses that it is essential for individuals to take responsibility for themselves with realistic assessment of their strengths and challenges. The book can be used as a workbook over several years beginning in high school and then beyond to school or work. It is a book to be read and re-read, sometimes only sections, sometimes whole chapter.

Steven Vale looks at fourteen European countries to show the diversity of surface mining machinery and techniques. He describes the regions in which the mining is set, provides information about the industries they serve and portrays some of the characters involved. Steven's fine photographs and detailed text then show the excavators, dozers, wheeled loaders and dump trucks, many of which are the largest in their classes. Some of these are veterans, others are the most modern available. He reveals why the mine managers selected particular brands, how they feel about their selection and whether they are likely to continue with the same choices in future. He also describes how the mines are facing up to the environmental challenges which increasingly affect them. Massive machines, with famous names - Liebherr, Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi, O&amp;K, Terex, LeTourneau, Demag, Bucyrus - will give enthusiasts plenty to savour in this first book to look comprehensively at European surface mining activity.</p><p>Steven Vale, an Englishman based in Holland, is European correspondent for Earthmovers magazine.

His vast building program aimed to modernize urban infrastructure, expand the public realm with extensive recreational facilities, remove blight, and make the city more livable for the middle class. This book offers a fresh look at the physical transformation of New York during Moses&#x2019;s nearly forty-year reign over city building from 1934 to 1968.It is hard to imagine that anyone will ever have the same impact on New York as did Robert Moses. In his various roles in city and state government, he reshaped the fabric of the city, and his legacy continues to touch the lives of all New Yorkers. Revered for most of his life, he is now one of the most controversial figures in the city&#x2019;s history. Robert Moses and the Modern City is the first major publication devoted to him since Robert Caro&#x2019;s damning 1974 biography, <em>The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York</em>.In these pages eight short essays by leading scholars of urban history provide a revised perspective; stunning new photographs offer the first visual record of Moses&#x2019;s far-reaching building program as it stands today; and a comprehensive catalog of his works is illustrated with a wealth of archival records: photographs of buildings, neighborhoods, and landscapes, of parks, pools, and playgrounds, of demolished neighborhoods and replacement housing and urban renewal projects, of bridges and highways; renderings of rejected designs and controversial projects that were defeated; and views of spectacular models that have not been seen since Moses made them for promotional purposes.<em>Robert Moses and the Modern City</em> captures research undertaken in the last three decades and will stimulate a new round of debate.</p><p><p><strong>Hilary Ballon</strong> is an architectural historian and professor at Columbia University.

C., in the nineteenth century closely paralleled the invention and development of photography &#x2014; a felicitous circumstance that made possible this valuable photographic record of the early years of the nation's capital. Culled from the archives of the Library of Congress, Smithsonian, Columbia Historical Society, and other sources, these 224 rare prints (including works by such Victorian-era cameramen as Brady, Bishop, Plumbe, Hiller, Peale, et al.) constitute a vivid and enduring record of a city in progress &#x2014; from sparsely settled provincial southern town to majestic seat of national power and influence.<br>In spite of their vintage (over half are pre-1900; the earliest a striking 1846 daguerreotype of the Capitol under construction), these priceless views retain an undiminished precision and clarity of detail that brings old Washington into sharp focus &#x2014; timeless reminders of how a city and its people looked as a metropolis of pomp and power grew up about them. From the slums of Purdy Court to the turreted mansions of Dupont Circle, from the massive marble monuments of "Federal" Washington, to the humble shops and saloons of 7th Street, these rare pictures recall places and events steeped in meaning for a nation and its citizens: Lincoln's first inauguration (1861); Ford&#x30d;'s Theater draped in mourning (1865); Grand Review of the Union Army (1865); Old Willard Hotel (housed Nathaniel Hawthorne, Lincoln, Grant, Tyler, Pierce); portrait of Frederick Douglass and family (1885); homes of Dolley Madison and Francis Scott Key; Women&#x2019;s Suffrage Parade (1913); and many other historic, social, and geographic landmarks.<br>This rich gallery of contemporary views also reveals nineteenth-century Washington as a showplace of architectural styles (Gothic Revival, Romanesque, Classical, Italian Renaissance, Victorian, etc.) employed to stunning effect by the master builders of the age: James Renwick (Smithsonian, Corcoran Gallery of Art); Benjamin Latrobe and Charles Bulfinch (Capitol); Robert Mills (Old Post Office, Patent Office, Treasury Building); Andrew Jackson Downing (Francis Dodge House); Henry Hobson Richardson (Henry Adams House), and many others.<br>Side by side with its architectural splendor, the mundane life of the city is recaptured in remarkable images of an era when beer was a nickel a bottle and cows still grazed within sight of the Capitol. Here are turn-of-the-century schoolchildren admiring the newly opened Library of Congress; summer crowds mingling on the White House lawn in the administration of Chester Arthur; an Easter Monday egg-roll in 1898; Marine Band concerts; idyllic outings at Rock Creek Park; bone-shaking rides on a velocipede; parades, celebrations, inaugurations, and many other vignettes of people, neighborhoods, and daily life.<br>The photos are arranged in an east-to-west geographic sequence (Capitol Hill to Georgetown) that roughly parallels the historic development of the city. Robert Reed has provided an informative introduction and captions, enhancing the unique and irreplaceable value of this collection. Historians, photographers, architects, visitors &#x2014; anyone interested in the process by which a muddy village on the banks of the Potomac became one of the great capitals of the world &#x2014; will want to have this book.</p><p></p><h2>30 Second Shakespeare (Hardback) /anglais</h2><p>30-Second Shakespeare</p><p></p><h2>Any Rough Times Are Now Behind You: Selected Poems and Writing : 1979-1995</h2><p>Any Rough Times Are Now Behind You: Selected Poems and Writing : 1979-1995</p><p></p><h2>Life Science Ethics</h2><p><p>Does nature have intrinsic value?

Piper is an internationally recognized conceptual artist and the only African American in the early conceptual art movement of the 1960s. The writings in <i>Out of Order, Out of Sight</i> trace the development of her thinking about her artwork and the art world, and her evolving awareness of herself as a creative, racial, and gendered subject situated in an often limiting and always absurd cultural and social context.</p></p><p>Professor of Philosophy at Wellesley College, Adrian Piper is a theorist/critic and a distinguished analytic philosopher whose research publications are in metaethics and Kant&#39;s metaphysics. She exhibits her work at the John Weber and Paula Cooper Galleries in New York.Words and language are integral to conceptual art, and conceptual artist/academic philosopher Piper can articulate this relation from a unique position and better than most. The artist has divided her writings into two types presented in their own chronologically arranged volumes. Meta-Art exists somewhere between art and art criticism and analyzes Piper's own works; Selected Writings examines the issues surrounding these works. The style is occasionally passionate and decidedly autobiographical, as a key ingredient of Piper's art is the merger of the personal and the political. An African American activist-artist who started out in the late 1960s as Sol LeWitt's assistant, Piper creates altered photographs, performances, and installations that deal with racism and social change. This collection is important not only for elucidating the artist's own work but also for chronicling the art world of the past 25 years and for Piper's influence on others.

It emphasizes how accomplished teachers gradually acquire and apply a broad repertoire of evidence-based teaching practices in the support of student learning. </p> <p>The book&#x2019;s content stems from three major fields of study: 1) theories and research on how people learn, including new insights from the cognitive and neurosciences; 2) research on classroom practices shown to have the greatest effect on student learning; and 3) research on effective schooling, defined as school-level factors that enhance student achievement and success. Although the book&#x2019;s major focus is on teaching, it devotes considerable space to describing how students learn and how the most effective and widely-used models of teaching connect to principles of student learning. Specifically, it describes how research on teaching, cognition, and neuroscience converge to provide an evidence-based "science of learning" which teachers can use to advance their practice. Key features include the following:</p> <p><strong>Evidence-Based Practice</strong> &#x2013; This theme is developed through: 1) an ongoing review and synthesis of research on teaching and learning and the resulting guidelines for practice and 2) boxed research summaries within the chapters. </p> <p><strong>Instructional Repertoire Theme</strong> &#x2013; Throughout the book teaching is viewed as an extremely complex activity that requires a repertoire of instructional strategies that, once mastered, can be drawn upon to fit specific classrooms and teaching situations. </p> <p><strong>Standards-based School Environments</strong> &#x2013; Education today is dominated by standards-based school environments. Unlike competing books, this one describes these environments and shows how they impact curriculum design and learning activities. The objective is to show how teachers can make standards-based education work for them.</p> <p><strong>Pedagogical Features</strong> &#x2013; In addition to an end-of-book glossary, each chapter contains research boxes, reflection boxes, itemized end-of-chapter summaries, and end-of-chapter learning activities. </p> <p><strong>Website</strong> &#x2013; An accompanying website contains a variety of field-oriented and site-based activities that teachers can do alone or with colleagues.</p></p><p><p><strong>Richard Arends</strong> is Emeritus Professor of Education and former Dean of the School of Education at Central Connecticut St. University. </p> <p></p> <p><strong>Ann Kilcher</strong> is President of Paideia Consulting Group, Inc., based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. </p><p>"Arends and Kilcher engage the reader in each chapter and provide reader-friendly knowledge and research that can be used by multiple audiences.

Debates are emerging about what direction public universities should be taking as we head into the twenty-first century. Why and to what extent should society know about science? This book will help readers come to an informed understanding about the place of science and technology in today&#39;s world.To put some of the adventure back in everyday science, this study is the place to start. Bauer, chemistry professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, upends current contentions about science literacy in a small, dense book that could be the nucleus of a restructuring of how science works in our culture, or, in the author's terms, how its reputation works. The call for more science literacy is a shibboleth in this STS-based (science, technology, society) exposition, which is a sort of deconstruction of the general image of science. Excising popular fallacies, Bauer argues that science is particular knowledge embedded in its time's social context and, therefore, in continuous change. His critique is radical: demystify the science we learn as fact ("textbook science"), keep "frontier science" (research) from being overwhelmed by structural forces in technocracy, avoid "scientism" as a basis of social policy. Science can be made to serve us better, stresses the author, but not as a new mythology. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Word Wasp: A Manual for Teaching the Rules and Structures of Spelling</h2><p>Word Wasp</p><p></p><h2>Advocacy and Opposition: An Introduction to Argumentation</h2><p>Advocacy and Opposition: An Introduction toArgumentation presents a comprehensive and practical approach to argumentation and critical thinking for the beginner who needs to construct and present arguments on questions of fact, value, and policy.

However, such equipment can be set up wrongly, interpreted incorrectly, malfunction or lose power. In these circumstances, knowledge of traditional navigation can become extremely important. This book will teach you how to navigate in the traditional way using compass, log and plotter; and also how to navigate using electronic aids like GPS, radar and chart plotter. In addition, you will learn some basic celestial navigation using the sun and stars to obtain your position using sextant, almanacs, tables and a watch. Each method of navigation is explained alongside detailed illustrations and examples, combining to make a straightforward and easy-to-follow guide.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Introduction<br><br>Contents<br><br>TRADITIONAL NAVIGATION: How charts are created, Latitude and longitude, Position, Using charts, Variation and deviation, Steering compass, Logs and echosounders, Plotting implements, Leeway and current, Handbearing compasses, Dead reckoning / bearings, Miscellaneous, Sailing at night, IALA buoyage system, Tide and tidal currents, Navigation lights, Summary<br><br>ELECTRONIC NAVIGATION: GPS, GPS &#x2013; how does it work?, GPS receivers, Using the GPS receiver, Chart plotters, Using the chart plotter, Waypoints and routes, Display setup, Receiver setup, Radar, Range / bearing discrimination, Radar operation, Adjusting the radar, Radar problems, Display setup, Collision avoidance, AIS<br><br>CELESTIAL NAVIGATION: The sun&#x2019;s geographic position, Astronomical model, Principles of celestial navigation, Hour angles, Noon sight, Measuring sun&#x2019;s altitude, UTC, zone and standard time, Working a sight, Sight reduction sheet, Taking the noon sight, Plotting position lines, Finding lat. and long. directly, Corrections, Stars, Polaris (North Star), Using a calculator<br><br>Appendix: Tables &amp; formulae.</p><p>This beautifully illustrated manual teaches you to navigate by traditional navigation, electronic navigation (using GPS and radar) and celestial navigation (using sextant, tables and a watch).<p>The author has been sailing for more than 25 years and has logged 50,000 nautical miles including three Atlantic crossings.</p>Ivar Dedekam, of Dedekam Design, specialises in uniquely illustrated nautical manuals which are easy to understand and remember.

Unlike other texts, Maxwell&#39;s equations and the associated vector mathematics are developed early in the work, allowing readers to apply them at the outset. Its unified treatment of coordinate systems saves time in developing the rules for vector manipulations in ways other than the rectangular coordinate system. The following chapters cover static and quasi-static electric and magnetic fields, wave reflection and transmission at plane boundaries, the Poynting power theorem, rectangular waveguide mode theory, transmission lines, and an introduction to the properties of linear antennas and aperture antennas. Includes an expanded set of problems, many of which extend the material developed in the chapters.</p><p><p>Carl T. A.

Dislocated from family and community, they were forced into an educational system that sought to erase their Indian identity as a means of acculturating them to white society. However, as historian John Gram reveals, some Indian communities on the edge of the American frontier had a much different experience&#x2015;even influencing the type of education their children received. <br><br>Shining a spotlight on Pueblo Indians' interactions with school officials at the Albuquerque and Santa Fe Indian Schools, Gram examines two rare cases of off-reservation schools that were situated near the communities whose children they sought to assimilate. Far from the federal government's reach and in competition with nearby Catholic schools for students, these Indian boarding school officials were in no position to make demands and instead were forced to pick their cultural battles with nearby Pueblo parents, who visited the schools regularly. As a result, Pueblo Indians were able to exercise their agency, influencing everything from classroom curriculum to school functions. As Gram reveals, they often mitigated the schools' assimilation efforts and assured the various pueblos' cultural, social, and economic survival.<br><br>Greatly expanding our understanding of the Indian boarding school experience,<i> Education at the Edge of Empire </i>is grounded in previously overlooked archival material and student oral histories. The result is a groundbreaking examination that contributes to Native American, Western, and education histories, as well as to borderland and Southwest studies. It will appeal to anyone interested in knowing how some Native Americans were able to use the typically oppressive boarding school experience to their advantage.</p><p><b>John R. Gram</b> teaches at Southern Methodist University."Gram provides a nuanced view of the power relationship between the Santa Fe and Albuquerque US government boarding schools and the New Mexico Indians these schools served from the 1880s into the 1930s."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i><p>"Scholars interested in Indian boarding schools, particularly as they compare to one another, will learn from this book, as will those who are interested in the intersecting ecologies of colonization and schooling. Gram's book, moreover, illustrates how education, particularly that of children, is a phenomenon that communities hold in a paramount position that need not be contained within the school itself."&#x2015;Andrea Lawrence, <i>History of Education Quarterly</i></p><p>"[N]ot your typical book about Indian schools. . . . Gram demonstrates a deeper complexity of the boarding school experience and its relationship to several dynamically active communities. . . . This book is well researched through multiple collections and draws on the existing scholarship in ways that show a keen intelligence and great synthesis while incorporating rich primary source materials, many of them gathered from the Santa Fe Indian School. It is amazingly approachable, phenomenally thorough, and easily teachable."&#x2015;Brian S. Collier, <i>Western Historical Quarterly</i></p><p>"[A]ccessible and interesting. . . . <i>Education at the Edge of Empire</i> is a wonderful addition to the literature of off-reservation boarding schools."&#x2015;Andrae Marak, <i>Journal of American History</i></p><p>"This book offers a fascinating and unexpected view of the Indian boarding experience. It is a welcome addition to Native American historiography and should be of interest to anyone who values a deeper understanding of the way in which Pueblo people in New Mexico were able to make an institution dedicated to destroying their way of life work instead for them."&#x2015;Rick Hendricks, <i>Southwestern Historical Quarterly</i></p><p>"The author does well to illustrate the unique and compelling relationship between Pueblo communities of the Southwest and the two boarding schools that served so many of their children, the Albuquerque Indian School (AIS) and the Santa Fe Indian School (SFIS). . . . Gram's study of AIS and SFIS provides not only a useful addition to the literature on American Indian boarding schools, but a valuable illustration of the limitations of imperial efforts toward Native people in a borderlands setting."&#x2015;John A. Goodwin, <i>American Indian Culture and Research Journal</i></p><p>"Adds new layers of complexity. . . . Gram aptly demonstrates how the nexus of national and local politics provided Pueblo people with opportunities to exact change from school officials.

Starting with 16th-century maritime manuscript atlases, once subsidized and collected by royalty and merchant princes, <i>Images of the World</i> tracks the atlas as it evolved into a 20th-century educational tool. Atlases map and shape their times, and <i>Images of the World</i> does a scholarly job of charting how well the atlases have reflected, and how strongly they've affected our world views over the years.Scholarly probings into the evolution of atlases as embodiments of science, philosophy, and artistry. A decade back, the Library of Congress, holder of the largest cartographic collection in the world, held a symposium on the past and future of the atlas as a means of recording and disseminating spatial information of all kinds, a graphic representation of the human occupancy of the earth. Participants were asked to consider the story of the atlas as a book, revealing the slow changes in printing, format, and color, identifying how these reflected the period of their production, and speculating on the fate of the printed atlas in the age of the database. The 15 essays in this heavily illustrated volume (first presented at the symposium) span the entire history of atlas-making around the world. Particularly good are contributions from Mei-Ling Hsu on the unusual concepts and celestial fixations of early Chinese atlases; Gunter Schilder on the evolution of pilot books from octavo booklets to the great folios of the nautical atlases; Walter W. Ristow on the publishers of early American atlases; and Barbara B. Petchenik on the future of printed maps (she suggests that they may soon be no more than a method of providing children with an understanding of spatial meaning, while the rest of us will be turning to software to answer cartographic questions). An adequate number of the maps are reproduced in color, though more might be wished for, and the editors, curators of the Library of Congress's map collection, could have enlivened the prose a tad, for some of the essays are dry to the point of aridity. Map lovers will be gratified to see their tax dollars put to such thoughtful, elegant, and tangible use. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But despite the many measures taken to overhaul the educational system, student math and reading scores rarely seem to improve. Taking the reader from the schools of ancient times to the present day, this Very Short Introduction explains why education has followed the path that it has taken-and what we might do to improve it. Education expert Gary Thomas delves into some of the big questions of education and the twists and turns the field has taken over time, looks at the work of such key thinkers as Piaget and Vygotsky, and examines such recent innovations as the introduction of progressive education in the 20th century and the marketization of schools over the last few decades. Thomas repeatedly returns to the question of why education has recently become so test-orientated and he explores the consequences of this obsession with testing for children. He also looks at moves that teachers and policy-makers have made to try to improve what goes on in schools, from changing teaching so that it mirrors the way children learn, to making schools more inclusive and meaningful for a broader range of students.<br><br>About the Series:<br><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the Very Short Introductions series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gary Thomas</strong> is Professor in Education at the University of Birmingham.

All around, the defeated remnants of Montrose's men are being harried and slaughtered by the faithful, and Sempill's plea for compassion, like his love for the beautiful Katrine Yester, is out of joint with the times.</p><p>There are still older conflicts to be faced however, symbolised by the presence of the Melanudrigill Wood, a last remnant of the ancient Caledonian forest. Here there is black magic to be uncovered, but also the more positive pre-Christian intimations of nature worship.</p><p>In such setting, and faced with the onset of the plague, David Sempill's struggle and eventual disappearance take on a strange and timeless aspect in what was John Buchan's own favourite among his many novels.</p></p><p><p>John Buchan (1875-1940), had a long and successful literary and public career. He was educated in Glasgow, where his father was a Free Church minister in the Gorbals, but his childhood holidays were spent in the Scottish border country.</p><p>After graduating at Glasgow University, Buchan took a scholarship to Oxford where he wrote his first two historical novels while still an undergraduate. With interests in law and journalism, he worked for the British High Commission in South Africa at the end of the Boer War. Returning to London in 1903, he eventually became a director of Thomas Nelson the publishers. Buchan worked for the Ministry of Information during WWI, and later wrote a substantial history of the conflict. He became a Tory MP for the Scottish Universities from 1927 to 1935, in which year he was appointed Governor-General of Canada as Lord Tweedsmuir.</p><p>Buchan took pride in the craft of story-telling and he is probably best known for his Richard Hannay thriller, with six titles ranging from The Thirty-Nine Steps in 1915, to The Island of Sheep in 1936. His other fiction includes <i>John Burnet of Barns</i> (1898), <i>Prester John</i> (1910), <i>Huntingtower</i> (1922), <i>John Macnab</i> (1925), <i>Witchwood</i> (1927) and <i>Sick Hear River, </i>published posthumously in 1941.</p><p>Buchan's health had never been strong, yet he achieved an enormous literary output in the course of his life, with no fewer than 30 novels and over 60 non-fiction books, including the fine biographies of Walter Scott and James Graham the Marquis of Montrose, whom he greatly admired.

This wide-ranging introductory textbook outlines the competing explanations of why environmental problems occur and examines the different political approaches taken to address them. Adopting a case study approach, Hayley Stevenson enables students to gain a detailed understanding of how theories and concepts are applied in practice. Diverse perspectives on a variety of contemporary environmental challenges, from climate change to hazardous waste, as well as various responses, from multilateral diplomacy to consumer-focused campaigns, provide students with an in-depth understanding of the merits and limitations of different forms of political action. Refined on the basis of classroom feedback, features include textboxes, key points, a glossary of key terms, questions, further reading suggestions and supplementary online resources. This lively book is an essential resource for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate courses on global environmental politics and environmental policy.</p><p>Outlining the competing explanations of why environmental problems occur, and examining the different political approaches taken to address them, this wide-ranging introduction is an essential resource for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate courses on global environmental politics and environmental policy.Hayley Stevenson is Associate Professor in International Relations at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, Buenos Aires, and Reader in Politics at the University of Sheffield.

Paul Slack assesses its causes, which have often been disputed and are now being illuminated by microbiologists and archaeologists, and he looks at possible reasons for its periodic disappearance from whole continents. He shows what plague meant for those who suffered from it, and how governments began to fight against it and in doing so invented modern notions of public health. His focus throughout the book is on how people coped with death and disease in epidemic crises.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul Slack</strong> is Emeritus Professor of Early Modern Social History at Oxford University and author of the classic study <em>The Impact of Plague in Tudor and Stuart England</em>.<br>This book is not a textbook on Pasteurella pestis.

The book contains the oral histories of twenty men, ranging in age from 30 to 94, who have lost their wives to a range of causes including cancer, alcohol, murder, and suicide. Taken together, the stories guide the reader through the journey of widowhood, from the raw despair of the early weeks to the resolved perspective thirteen years later, offered by the only true authority on the subject - the men who have survived it.</p></p><p>Campbell and Silverman delve into the psyches of men who have had to withstand the death of a spouse. Men, the book makes clear, mourn differently than women. They are less expressive, often very reticent, and this submerging of emotions can be harmful, physically as well as psychologically. The oral histories of 20 men who have lost their wives are not presented here as a curative but to show how these men have successfully dealt with the shock and devastation of suddenly being without the person they loved. Their emotions range from despair and rage, to a hollow sense of having no purpose, to incredulity over the inappropriate condolences offered by friends and family. After each history, an insightful commentary is provided by Silverman, a practicing psychologist. Written to aid the widower but equally useful for anyone with a friend or relative dealing with such a terrible loss. <i>Brian McCombie</i></p><h2>Studying Culture: An Introductory Reader (Hodder Arnold Publication)</h2><p>This lively and stimulating resource book for students of cultural studies traces the formation of the field in Britain and its subsequent development internationally.

In <em>Confederate Emancipation</em>, Bruce Levine looks closely at such Confederate plans to arm and free slaves. He shows that within a year of Cleburne's proposal, which was initially rejected out of hand, Jefferson Davis, Judah P. Benjamin, and Robert E. Lee had all reached the same conclusions. At that point, the idea was debated widely in newspapers and drawing rooms across the South, as more and more slaves fled to Union lines and fought in the ranks of the Union army. Eventually, the soldiers of Lee's army voted on the proposal, and the Confederate government actually enacted a version of it in March. The Army issued the necessary orders just two weeks before Appomattox, too late to affect the course of the war. Throughout the book, Levine captures the voices of blacks and whites, wealthy planters and poor farmers, soldiers and officers, and newspaper editors and politicians from all across the South. In the process, he sheds light on such hot-button topics as what the Confederacy was fighting for, whether black southerners were willing to fight in large numbers in defense of the South, and what this episode foretold about life and politics in the post-war South. <br> <em>Confederate Emancipation</em> offers an engaging and illuminating account of a fascinating and politically charged idea, setting it firmly and vividly in the context of the Civil War and the part played in it by the issue of slavery and the actions of the slaves themselves.<br></p><p>"Having fought for nearly four years to keep their bondsmen in slavery, many Southern whites experienced what amounted to a deathbed conversion to the idea of freeing and arming them to fight for the Confederacy. As Bruce Levine shows in this important book, the idea was unlikely to become reality even if Appomattox had not intervened to end the experiment before it fairly started. Disentangling myth from history, Confederate Emancipation deepens our understanding of the Civil War."--James M. McPherson, author of <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i> <p>"This is the little known, but vastly significant story of race at the crisis-point of the Confederacy. In clear and compelling tones, Levine sets out a history of the Civil War era through the words and actions of southerners pushed to the point of desperation, and hoping that slave soldiers might save the slavery-based southern way of life. This is historical detective work and analysis at its very best. The image of the Civil War South is transformed forever."--James O. Horton, co-author of <i>Slavery and the Making of America</i> </p><p>"The Civil War produced few more ironic episodes than the Confederacy's debate about whether to arm and liberate enslaved African Americans. Bruce Levine's welcome study illuminates the conditions that gave rise to the debate, the forces arrayed in favor and against the idea, and the ultimate failure of those who saw black men as the key to establishing a white slaveholding republic. This book, which reminds us again of the war's immense complexity, deserves to attract the widest possible audience."--Gary W. Gallagher, author of <i>The Confederate War </i></p><p><i>"Throughout history, slaves have been armed in defense of their masters, often exchanging freedom for military service. The inability of the Southern Confederacy to do so until its doom was sealed reveals, perhaps as nothing else, the essence of Southern nationalism. In telling the full story of the Confederacy's failure to mobilize slaves in its defense, Bruce Levine brilliantly reveals the essence of Confederate nationality."--Ira Berlin, author of <i>Generations of Captivity: A History of African-American Slaves</i></i></p><br><strong>Bruce Levine</strong> is James G.

For most, when receiving a new toy, half the fun is ripping open the package and playing with it. However, the growing appeal toward the line of Hot Wheels? Collector Number Packs?a numbered line of cars distributed by Mattel with slight variations, where the color, wheel, interior or window might have been altered?is them remaining in the original packaging. Author and Hot Wheels? collector, Michael Zarnock expands coverage of the most comprehensive identification and price guide available to include variations found in blister packages from 1989-2002. More than 2,500 cars and their variations are listed and nearly 2,500 are pictured in clear, large full-color photographs. Plus, readers can now step behind the scenes with exclusive information from Mattel on how these cars are created.</p><p>Author/Freelance writer, Michael S. Zarnock writes Collector Guides and Articles about Hot Wheels� toy cars and is one of the worlds most respected authorities on Hot Wheels� and also holds a Guinness World Record &#x2122; for his Hot Wheels� collection. <p>Michael was born April 21, 1958 in Utica, New York, into a working class family. </p><p>As with most young men of that time, he grew up with aspirations of getting married and working with his dad in their family Body Shop repairing cars. But, as we all know, things change. His parents divorced in 1974 and his dad moved to Florida. Michael stayed in Utica with his mom and attended local schools while working as a Auto Mechanic at "Nichols Dept. Store". He has worked full time since the 11th grade. "Everybody thought it was pretty weird that I came to school with my blue work shirt that had "Mike" on it everyday. They couldn&#x2019;t understand that I worked 45 hours a week while I was still in High School. They were all playing sports and hanging out while I was turning wrenches and fixing their parents cars." He graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in 1976. </p><p>Some of Michael&#x2019;s accomplishments over the years include racing Moto Cross as a teenager to building and driving many Show and Drag Cars as an adult. Some of those Drag Cars ended up being Street Racers for other people. Michael has many stories&#x2019; about those Street Racing days that he says he would like to put in a book, including the time he got kidnapped. He says, "Hey, It could happen. Who would have thought I would write books about Hot Wheels� ?" </p><p>The mid 1980&#x2019;s brought another challenge to Michael when he became a singer/drummer and co-wrote songs in a band called "The Blister Tones". After 3 years and 3 Albums, the band split and he went back to working on his house and collecting Hot Wheels� again. </p><p>It&#x2019;s come to be, that Michael has spent so much time and effort on his collection that he has become one of the world&#x2019;s most respected authorities on Hot Wheels� and their variations. </p><p>So much so, that it prompted him to write a best selling Variation Guide called "The Ultimate Guide to Hot Wheels � Variations", that went into it&#x2019;s second printing. The 2nd. Edition is written and scheduled for a March 2004 release. He has also done the "Warmans' Hot Wheels� Field Guide", the Hot Wheels� Collector Numbers section in "The Standard Catalog of Die-Cast Vehicles", "Toys &amp; Prices 2004" and a few others that are currently under development. All of these and future publications are available at Bookstores around the world. If you&#x2019;re looking for up to date Hot Wheels� information, Michael is currently under contract with "Toy Cars &amp; Models�" magazine where he writes a monthly Hot Wheels� Variation Guide. In his column he talks about the most current Variations to be looking for along with prices. </p><p>Michael also makes appearances at Schools, Conventions, Toy Shows and Hot Wheels Club functions across the United States and Canada. You never know where you'll find him. Michael has even made a couple appearances in the movies. He made his screen debut playing Artie, the sleazy comic book publisher in the "Catch Your Breath Production" film "Detour", and returned to take on the role of Freddy Grecko, talk show host extraordinaire in "The Death of Daniel Whately". </p><p>Michael now lives in a small town right outside of Utica called Deerfield, and teaches computer at a local elementary school. He lives there with his wife Tina and their son Cody. Michael&#x2019;s older son Christopher, who is grown, now lives in Fredrick, Maryland and enjoys building real cars like his dad.</p></p><h2>Jennie C. Jones: Compilation</h2><p>The work of Jennie C.

By following container ships as they travel downstream along maritime routes and tracing rivers upstream across the populated watershed that feeds the canal, he explores the politics of environmental management around a waterway that links faraway ports and markets to nearby farms, forests, cities, and rural communities. </p><p>Carse draws on a wide range of ethnographic and archival material to show the social and ecological implications of transportation across Panama. The Canal moves ships over an aquatic staircase of locks that demand an enormous amount of fresh water from the surrounding region. Each passing ship drains 52 million gallons out to sea&#x2015;a volume comparable to the daily water use of half a million Panamanians. </p><p>Infrastructures like the Panama Canal, Carse argues, do not simply conquer nature; they rework ecologies in ways that serve specific political and economic priorities. Interweaving histories that range from the depopulation of the U.S. Canal Zone a century ago to road construction conflicts and water hyacinth invasions in canal waters, the book illuminates the human and nonhuman actors that have come together at the margins of the famous trade route. 2014 marks the 100th anniversary of the Panama Canal. <i>Beyond the Big Ditch</i> calls us to consider how infrastructures are materially embedded in place, producing environments with winners and losers. </p></p><p>Ashley Carse is Assistant Professor in the Department of Human and Organizational Development at Vanderbilt University.<p>The best works in environmental anthropology often redirect our attention, showing us something on the landscape that we had been looking at all along but not seeing. In a fine example of this tradition, Ashley Carse suggests that in order to understand infrastructure like the Panama Canal, we need to turn it 'upside down' to examine its otherwise unexamined 'background work.' Going 'beyond the big ditch,' Carse gives us an engrossing history and ethnography of the canal's headwaters, floodplain, interior, and backwaters. Whereas the canal is an icon of global assembly and connection, in this important new work Carse tells the untold story of the dis-assembly and dis-connection that have also attended its construction and operation&#x2015;a tension that continues to play out down to the present day.</p>&#x2015;<b>Michael R. Dove</b>, Margaret K. Musser Professor of Social Ecology, Yale University; author of <i>The Banana Tree at the Gate: A History of Marginal Peoples and Global Markets in Borneo</i><br><br><p>For a century we have celebrated the Panama Canal as a discrete and complete work of heroic engineering. But, as Ashley Carse suggests in this important new book, the canal is better conceptualized as a piece of living infrastructure, one that has reached beyond its banks, into the lives and landscapes of Panamanians and other global citizens. By redefining what the Panama Canal is, and how it works, Carse has given us a powerful new narrative of environmental modernity.</p>&#x2015;<b>Paul Sutter</b>, Associate Professor of History, University of Colorado at Boulder<br><br><p><i>Beyond the Big Ditch</i> is a thoughtful, deeply informed, multifaceted, and nuanced look at the history, meanings, and varied impact of the Panama Canal. Ashley Carse's transdisciplinary approach is masterful, allowing the reader to see physical infrastructure in its inception, construction, maintenance, and decay, as an evolving entity and force in social, political, economic, and ecological realms. This immensely valuable text is an essential read for students and scholars in environmental social science, international development, earth science, and civil engineering.</p>&#x2015;<b>Barbara Rose Johnston</b>, Senior Research Fellow, Center for Political Ecology; editor of <i>Water, Cultural Diversity, and Global Environmental Change</i></p><h2>Practice Book Consumable Volume 2 Grade 3 (Journeys)</h2><p>Grade 3 Practice Book covering Lessons 16-30</p><p></p><h2>Toads and Tessellations (Charlesbridge Math Adventures)</h2><p>Enzo is the son of a great magician, however unlike his father, his spells create chaos instead of order. What really interests Enzo, more than books about magic, are books by and about the lives of famous physicists and astronomers like Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler. Enzo dreams not of becoming a magician, but a mathematician instead. When Tessel, the village shoemaker, is called upon to make twelve identical shoes out of only one piece of leather, Aida, the shoemaker&#x2019;s sister, goes to Enzo&#x2019;s father for some magic to help her brother. With Enzo&#x2019;s father out of town at a magic convention, it&#x2019;s up to Enzo to help Aida and Tessel out of their predicament. A spell snafu leads Enzo and Aida to a method of forming patterns without gaps or overlaps, and they discover that math, not magic, may be the answer to their problem.

The Nabokovs were known for their high culture and commitment to public service, and the elder Nabokov was an outspoken opponent of anti-Semitism and one of the leaders of the opposition party, the Kadets. In 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution, he took his family into exile. Four years later he was shot and killed at a political rally in Berlin while trying to shield the speaker from right-wing assassins.&nbsp; The Nabokov household was trilingual, and as a child Nabokov was already reading Wells, Poe, Browning, Keats, Flaubert, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Tolstoy, and Chekhov alongside the popular entertainments of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne. As a young man, he studied Slavic and romance languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his honors degree in 1922. For the next&nbsp;18 years he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym "Sirin" and supporting himself through translations, lessons in English and tennis, and by composing the first crossword puzzles in Russian. In 1925, he married Vera Slonim, with whom he had one child, a son, Dmitri.&nbsp; Having already fled Russia and Germany, Nabokov became a refugee once more in 1940, when he was forced to leave France for the United States. There he taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell. He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English. His most notable works include <i>Bend Sinister&nbsp;</i>(1947),&nbsp;<i>Lolita</i>&nbsp;(1955),&nbsp;<i>Pnin</i>&nbsp;(1957), and&nbsp;<i>Pale Fire</i>&nbsp;(1962), as well as the translation of his earlier Russian novels into English. He also undertook English translations of works by Lermontov and Pushkin and wrote several books of criticism. Vladimir Nabokov died in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977.THE RETURN OF CHORB<br><br>The Kellers left the opera house at a late hour. In that pacific German city, where the very air seemed a little lusterless and where a transverse row of ripples had kept shading gently the reflected cathedral for well over seven centuries, Wagner was a leisurely affair presented with relish so as to overgorge one with music. After the opera Keller took his wife to a smart nightclub renowned for its white wine. It was past one in the morning when their car, flippantly lit on the inside, sped through lifeless streets to deposit them at the iron wicket of their small but dignified private house. Keller, a thickset old German, closely resembling Oom Paul Kruger, was the first to step down on the sidewalk, across which the loopy shadows of leaves stirred in the streetlamp's gray glimmer. For an instant his starched shirtfront and the droplets of bugles trimming his wife's dress caught the light as she disengaged a stout leg and climbed out of the car in her turn. The maid met them in the vestibule and, still carried by the momentum of the news, told them in a frightened whisper about Chorb's having called. Frau Keller's chubby face, whose everlasting freshness somehow agreed with her Russian merchant-class parentage, quivered and reddened with agitation.<br><br>"He said she was ill?"<br><br>The maid whispered still faster. Keller stroked his gray brush of hair with his fat palm, and an old man's frown overcast his large, somewhat simian face, with its long upper lip and deep furrows.<br><br>"I simply refuse to wait till tomorrow," muttered Frau Keller, shaking her head as she gyrated heavily on one spot, trying to catch the end of the veil that covered her auburn wig. "We'll go there at once. Oh dear, oh dear! No wonder there's been no letters for quite a month."<br><br>Keller punched his gibus open and said in his precise, slightly guttural Russian: "The man is insane. How dare he, if she's ill, take her a second time to that vile hotel?"<br><br>But they were wrong, of course, in thinking that their daughter was ill. Chorb said so to the maid only because it was easier to utter. In point of fact he had returned alone from abroad and only now realized that, like it or not, he would have to explain how his wife had perished, and why he had written nothing about it to his in-laws. It was all very difficult. How was he to explain that he wished to possess his grief all by himself, without tainting it by any foreign substance and without sharing it with any other soul? Her death appeared to him as a most rare, almost unheard-of occurrence; nothing, it seemed to him, could be purer than such a death, caused by the impact of an electric stream, the same stream which, when poured into glass receptacles, yields the purest and brightest light.<br><br>Ever since that spring day when, on the white highway a dozen kilometers from Nice, she had touched, laughing, the live wire of a storm-felled pole, Chorb's entire world ceased to sound like a world: it retreated at once, and even the dead body that he carried in his arms to the nearest village struck him as something alien and needless.<br><br>In Nice, where she had to be buried, the disagreeable consumptive clergyman kept in vain pressing him for details: Chorb responded only with a languid smile. He sat daylong on the shingly beach, cupping colored pebbles and letting them flow from hand to hand; and then, suddenly, without waiting for the funeral, he traveled back to Germany.<br><br>He passed in reverse through all the spots they had visited together during their honeymoon journey. In Switzerland where they had wintered and where the apple trees were now in their last bloom, he recognized nothing except the hotels. As to the Black Forest, through which they had hiked in the preceding autumn, the chill of the spring did not impede memory. And just as he had tried, on the southern beach, to find again that unique rounded black pebble with the regular little white belt, which she had happened to show him on the eve of their last ramble, so now he did his best to look up all the roadside items that retained her exclamation mark: the special profile of a cliff, a hut roofed with a layer of silvery-gray scales, a black fir tree and a footbridge over a white torrent, and something which one might be inclined to regard as a kind of fatidic prefiguration: the radial span of a spider's web between two telegraph wires that were beaded with droplets of mist. She accompanied him: her little boots stepped rapidly, and her hands never stopped moving, moving-to pluck a leaf from a bush or stroke a rock wall in passing-light, laughing hands that knew no repose. He saw her small face with its dense dark freckles, and her wide eyes, whose pale greenish hue was that of the shards of glass licked smooth by the sea waves. He thought that if he managed to gather all the little things they had noticed together-if he re-created thus the near past-her image would grow immortal and replace her forever. Nighttime, though, was unendurable. Night imbued with sudden terror her irrational presence. He hardly slept at all during the three weeks of his trek-and now he got off, quite drugged with fatigue, at the railway station, which had been last autumn their point of departure from the quiet town where he had met and married her.<br><br>It was around eight o'clock of the evening. Beyond the houses the cathedral tower was sharply set off in black against a golden-red stripe of sunset. In the station square stood in file the selfsame decrepit fiacres. The identical newspaper seller uttered his hollow crepuscular cry. The same black poodle with apathetic eyes was in the act of raising a thin hindleg near a Morris pillar, straight at the scarlet lettering of a playbill announcing <i>Parsifal</i>.<br><br>Chorb's luggage consisted of a suitcase and a big tawny trunk. A fiacre took him through the town. The cabby kept indolently flapping his reins, while steadying the trunk with one hand. Chorb remembered that she whom he never named liked to take rides in cabs.<br><br>In a lane at the corner of the municipal opera house there was an old three-storied hotel of a disreputable type with rooms that were let by the week, or by the hour. Its black paint had peeled off in geographical patterns; ragged lace curtained its bleary windows; its inconspicuous front door was never locked. A pale but jaunty lackey led Chorb down a crooked corridor reeking of dampness and boiled cabbage into a room which Chorb recognized-by the picture of a pink baigneuse in a gilt frame over the bed-as the very one in which he and his wife had spent their first night together. Everything amused her then-the fat man in his shirtsleeves who was vomiting right in the passage, and the fact of their having chosen by chance such a beastly hotel, and the presence of a lovely blond hair in the washbasin; but what tickled her most was the way they had escaped from her house. Immediately upon coming home from church she ran up to her room to change, while downstairs the guests were gathering for supper. Her father, in a dress coat of sturdy cloth, with a flabby grin on his apish face, clapped this or that man on the shoulder and served ponies of brandy himself. Her mother, in the meantime, led her closest friends, two by two, to inspect the bedroom meant for the young couple: with tender emotion, whispering under her breath, she pointed out the colossal eiderdown, the orange blossoms, the two pairs of brand-new bedroom slippers-large checkered ones, and tiny red ones with pompons-that she had aligned on the bedside rug, across which a Gothic inscription ran: "WE ARE TOGETHER UNTO THE TOMB." Presently, everybody moved toward the hors d'oeuvres-and Chorb and his wife, after the briefest of consultations, fled through the back door, and only on the following morning, half an hour before the express train was to leave, reappeared to collect their luggage. Frau Keller had sobbed all night; her husband, who had always regarded Chorb (destitute Russian �migr� and litt�rateur) with suspicion, now cursed his daughter's choice, the cost of the liquor, the local police that could do nothing. And several times, after the Chorbs had gone, the old man went to look at the hotel in the lane behind the opera house, and henceforward that black, purblind house became an object of disgust and attraction to him like the recollection of a crime.<br><br>While the trunk was being brought in, Chorb kept staring at the rosy chromo. When the door closed, he bent over the trunk and unlocked it. In a corner of the room, behind a loose strip of wallpaper, a mouse made a scuffing noise and then raced like a toy on rollers. Chorb turned on his heel with a start. The lightbulb hanging from the ceiling on a cord swayed ever so gently, and the shadow of the cord glided across the green couch and broke at its edge. It was on that couch that he had slept on his nuptial night. She, on the regular bed, could be heard breathing with the even rhythm of a child. That night he had kissed her once-on the hollow of the throat-that had been all in the way of lovemaking.<br><br>The mouse was busy again. There exist small sounds that are more frightening than gunfire. Chorb left the trunk alone and paced the room a couple of times. A moth struck the lamp with a ping. Chorb wrenched the door open and went out.<br><br>On the way downstairs he realized how weary he was, and when he found himself in the alley the blurry blue of the May night made him dizzy. Upon turning into the boulevard he walked faster. A square. A stone <i>Herzog</i>. The black masses of the City Park. Chestnut trees now were in flower. Then, it had been autumn. He had gone for a long stroll with her on the eve of the wedding. How good was the earthy, damp, somewhat violety smell of the dead leaves strewing the sidewalk! On those enchanting overcast days the sky would be of a dull white, and the small twig-reflecting puddle in the middle of the black pavement resembled an insufficiently developed photograph. The gray-stone villas were separated by the mellow and motionless foliage of yellowing trees, and in front of the Kellers' house the leaves of a withering poplar had acquired the tone of transparent grapes. One glimpsed, too, a few birches behind the bars of the gate; ivy solidly muffed some of their boles, and Chorb made a point of telling her that ivy never grew on birches in Russia, and she remarked that the foxy tints of their minute leaves reminded her of spots of tender rust upon ironed linen. Oaks and chestnuts lined the sidewalk; their black bark was velveted with green rot; every now and then a leaf broke away to fly athwart the street like a scrap of wrapping paper. She attempted to catch it on the wing by means of a child's spade found near a heap of pink bricks at a spot where the street was under repair. A little way off the funnel of a workers' van emitted gray-blue smoke which drifted aslant and dissolved between the branches-and a resting workman, one hand on his hip, contemplated the young lady, as light as a dead leaf, dancing about with that little spade in her raised hand. She skipped, she laughed. Chorb, hunching his back a bit, walked behind her-and it seemed to him that happiness itself had that smell, the smell of dead leaves.<br><br>At present he hardly recognized the street, encumbered as it was with the nocturnal opulence of chestnut trees. A streetlamp glinted in front; over the glass a branch drooped, and several leaves at its end, saturated with light, were quite translucent. He came nearer. The shadow of the wicket, its checkerwork all distorted, swept up toward him from the sidewalk to entangle his feet. Beyond the gate, and beyond a dim gravel walk, loomed the front of the familiar house, dark except for the light in one open window. Within that amber chasm the housemaid was in the act of spreading with an ample sweep of her arms a snow-bright sheet on a bed. Loudly and curtly Chorb called out to her. With one hand he still gripped the wicket and the dewy touch of iron against his palm was the keenest of all memories.<br><br>The maid was already hurrying toward him. As she was to tell Frau Keller later, what struck her first was the fact that Chorb remained standing silently on the sidewalk although she had unlocked the little gate at once. "He had no hat," she related, "and the light of the streetlamp fell on his forehead, and his forehead was all sweaty, and the hair was glued to it by the sweat. I told him master and mistress were at the theater. I asked him why he was alone. His eyes were blazing, their look terrified me, and he seemed not to have shaved for quite a time. He said softly: 'Tell them that she is ill.' I asked: 'Where are you staying?' He said: 'Same old place,' and then added: 'That does not matter. I'll call again in the morning.' I suggested he wait-but he didn't reply and went away."<br><br>Thus Chorb traveled back to the very source of his recollections, an agonizing and yet blissful test now drawing to a close. All there remained was but a single night to be spent in that first chamber of their marriage, and by tomorrow the test would be passed and her image made perfect.<br><br>But as he trudged back to the hotel, up the boulevard, where on all the benches in the blue darkness sat hazy figures, Chorb suddenly understood that, despite exhaustion, he would not be able to sleep alone in that room with its naked bulb and whispery crannies. He reached the square and plodded along the city's main avenue-and now he knew what must be done. His quest, however, lasted a long while: This was a quiet and chaste town, and the secret by-street where one could buy love was unknown to Chorb. Only after an hour of helpless wandering, which caused his ears to sing and his feet to burn, did he enter that little lane-whereupon he accosted at once the first girl who hailed him.<br><br>"The night," said Chorb, scarcely unclenching his teeth.<br><br>The girl cocked her head, swung her handbag, and replied: "Twenty-five."</p><h2>Adventures in Singing: A Process for Exploring, Discovering, and Developing Vocal Potential</h2><p>Ware, Clifton</p><p>Clifton Ware, University of Minnesota</p><h2>Brothers of the Quill: Oliver Goldsmith in Grub Street</h2><p><p>Oliver Goldsmith arrived in England in 1756 a penniless Irishman. He toiled for years in the anonymity of Grub Street&#x2015;already a synonym for impoverished hack writers&#x2015;before he became one of literary London&#x2019;s most celebrated authors. Norma Clarke tells the extraordinary story of this destitute scribbler turned gentleman of letters as it unfolds in the early days of commercial publishing, when writers&#x2019; livelihoods came to depend on the reading public, not aristocratic patrons. Clarke examines a network of writers radiating outward from Goldsmith: the famous and celebrated authors of Dr. Johnson&#x2019;s &#x201c;Club&#x201d; and those far less fortunate &#x201c;brothers of the quill&#x201d; trapped in Grub Street.</p><p>Clarke emphasizes Goldsmith&#x2019;s sense of himself as an Irishman, showing that many of his early literary acquaintances were Irish �migr�s: Samuel Derrick, John Pilkington, Paul Hiffernan, and Edward Purdon. These writers tutored Goldsmith in the ways of Grub Street, and their influence on his development has not previously been explored. Also Irish was the patron he acquired after 1764, Robert Nugent, Lord Clare. Clarke places Goldsmith in the tradition of Anglo-Irish satirists beginning with Jonathan Swift. He transmuted troubling truths about the British Empire into forms of fable and nostalgia whose undertow of Irish indignation remains perceptible, if just barely, beneath an equanimous English surface.</p><p>To read <i>Brothers of the Quill</i> is to be taken by the hand into the darker corners of eighteenth-century Grub Street, and to laugh and cry at the absurdities of the writing life.</p></p><p>Norma Clarke is Professor of English Literature at Kingston University.[Clarke] has created a colorful, canny, immensely readable book which rehearses, underlines and proclaims the importance, not only of Goldsmith himself, but also of his writerly world, of fraternal compatriots and infernal enemies, and of the ways that he and they found&#x2015;or didn&#x2019;t&#x2015;to get by...She is a wizard at telling stories...You will get a helpful sense of the nature of all of Goldsmith&#x2019;s lasting work from <i>Brothers of the Quill</i>...[A] rich volume. (Min Wild <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>[Clarke&#x2019;s] careful tracing of the networks of Irish affiliation in mid-18th-century London yields a completely new vision of both Goldsmith and the London he inhabited. Clarke concludes with a lament for the &#x2018;taken-for-grantedness&#x2019; of the contributions of Irish writers to English literature in the 18th century. The braided, archipelagic histories of these islands have yet to be completed, but are certainly enhanced by this study of Goldsmith. (Moyra Haslett <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>The book often reads like a collection of interconnected short stories.

Fusing classic cases of neuropsychology with the author's own case studies, personal vignettes, philosophical debate, and thought provoking riffs and meditations on the nature of neurological impairments and dysfunctions.<br><br>Some highlights include:<br><br>"I Don't Love You Anymore, Do I, Love?": two men who suffer almost mirror image traumatic lesions to the brain learn to cope with the loss of their ability to empathize with other human beings, thus living a life without highs or lows, only sedation. This recalls the classic case of railway worker named Finneas Gage. Gage accidentally had a railroad spike slammed into his head, piercing his frontal lobe. Miraculously, he wasn't killed, but surgeons of the day were unable to extract the spike for fear that it would cause further damage. Thus Finneas was forced to live the rest of his life with the spike in place in his head. As a result of the damage to the lobe however, Finneas would fly into blind rages for no reason at all. Psychologists concluded from this study that hostility is connected to physiological events occurring in the frontal lobe.<br><br>"The Sea and the Almond": a young woman who suffers from daily grand mal seizures agrees to a radical surgery that involves removal of the amygdala (from the Greek for almond) and part of the hippocampus (seahorse), which is responsible for memory and all conscious recall. Broks' experiences recall a classic neuropsychological case where a patient named H.M. had intractable epilepsy. The only way to cure the epilepsy was to remove the focus of the seizures, which were starting independently from both temporal lobes. Both lobes were removed and the seizures stopped, but the patient's memory was gone, along with the ability to create new memories. The patient had to be reintroduced to his coworkers on a daily basis, and would mistake pictures of himself for his father.<br><br>"The Ghost Tree": A woman infected with a common cold sore virus (herpes simplex) is onset with a severe infection that finds it way into her brain, where large areas of the anterior temporal lobes have been eaten away. As a result, she has a combination of 'fearlessness' (or 'recklessness') whereby she'll walk into traffic, or stand by with a smile on her face during a mugging, while on the other hand cower in fear over an argument on a TV soap opera.<br><br>"The Blue Bicycle": A young girl is struck by a car in front of her father while riding her brand new blue bicycle.

Sacks relates whole cases, such as "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat," laying out the brain physiology and the panoply of behavioral distortions involved in neurological abnormality. Broks, a psychologist rather than a physician like Sacks, uses cases as jumping-off points for essays in search of personality, unique consciousness, the soul. He believes there is something in the brain that neuroscience may never find or explain, and that gives each of us the sense of self. Moreover, he posits that dualism is inescapable for consciousness, which demands that each of us discriminate between physical and mental "parts" of the self, despite the inseparability of those parts. While he has readers chewing those insoluble nuggets, he tells his patients' and his own riveting stories, at least one of which, "To be two or not to be," is science fiction of the very highest order. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This approach allows the reader to learn the pathophysiology of the major diseases, and analyze each case in a way that more closely approximates the clinical practice of medicine; not knowing which organ system is damaged or compromised before examining the patient. The cases are based on real patients and the diseases are either common in emergency practice, or are dangerous diagnoses not to be missed. The case descriptions include questions regarding the patient&#39;s presentation and basic information about the disease, illustrating key elements from the history, physical, and when necessary ancillary studies that help lead to a diagnosis. Each chapter ends with a flow diagram showing how diseases of different organ systems can present with similar initial complaints.

He was taken to Rome for his education with the idea of a public career and by the year 70 he had established himself as the leading barrister in Rome. In the meantime his political career was well under way and he was elected praetor for the year 66. One of the most permanent features of his political life was his attachment to Pompeii. As a politician, his greatest failing was his consistent refusal to compromise; as a statesman his ideals were more honorable and unselfish than those of his contemporaries. Cicero was the greatest of the roman orators, posessing a wide range of technique and an excpetional command of the Latin tongue. He followed the common practice of publishing his speeches, but he also produced a large number of works on the theory and practice of rhetoric, on religion, and on moral and political philosophy. He played a leading part in the development of the Latin hexameter. Perhaps the most interesting of all his works is the collection fo 900 remarkably informative letters, published posthumously. These not only contain a first-hand account of social and political life in the upper classes at Rome, but also reflect the changing personal feelings of an emotional and sensitive man.Text: English, Latin (translation)</p><h2>On the Unseriousness of Human Affairs: Teaching, Writing, Playing, Believing, Lecturing, Philosophizing, Singing, Dancing</h2><p>To the ears of ceaselessly busy and ambitious modern Westerners, it will come as a shock, and perhaps as an insult, to be told that human affairs are "unserious." But this fundamental truth is exactly what Georgetown professor James Schall has to teach us in this wise and witty book. Following Plato, Schall argues that singing, dancing, playing, contemplating, and other "useless" human activities are not merely forms of escape from more important things - including politics, work, and social activism - but an indication of the freedom in and for which men and women were created.<br>Echoing philosophers such as Josef Pieper, Schall explains how the modern world has inverted the rational order of human affairs, devaluing the activities of leisure and placing an exaggerated emphasis on utilitarian concerns. Though he does not deny the importance of those necessary and prosaic activities that take up the bulk of our daily lives, Schall puts these pursuits in perspective by asking, what do we do when everything we have to do is done?</p><p>&#34;James Schall has reminded us of an eternal verity: that great wisdom can to be found in things considered foolish. In an age where our discussions are all too grim, this book opens the window to a fresh, reorienting breeze.&#34;--Frederica Matthewes- Green &#34;Professors only very rarely possess Schall&#39;s combination of erudition, thoughtfulness, clarity, and self-confidence.&#34;--Peter Augustine Lawler, Professor of Political Science, Berry College &#34;Although the prolific Rev. James Schall is a theologically informed political philosopher, have no fear. He writes good, clear English. And non-Catholics need not worry about being fed narrow sectarianism or political dogmas. Father Schall&#39;s favorite authorities include not only Aristotle and Aquinas, but such moderns as Samuel Johnson, Leo Strauss, and Eric Voegelin--not a Catholic among them.&#34;--Eugene Genovese, The Washington Times. &#34;Another gem from Fr. Schall, that combines delightful readability with utter practicality. A worthy successor to Joseph Pieper&#39;s classic Leisure, the Basis of Culture. Schall is the best literary matchmaker I know: after you read him you just have to go out and buy a dozen great books, which, having been his lifelong friends and sources of wisdom, become yours. His latest book is (as befits a lover of Chestertonian paradoxes) Countercultural, and therefore culturally relevant; &#39;unserious&#39; and therefore serious; personal and particular and therefore universal.&#34;--Peter Kreeft, Professor of Philosophy, Boston CollegeJames V.

It draws examples from the full range of the Western tradition, including classical, Renaissance, and contemporary art, with special focus on the modern era. It was in the modern period, when arguments about homosexuality and the avant-garde were especially public, that our current conception of the artist and the homosexual began to take shape, and almost as quickly to overlap. Not a chronology of gay or lesbian artists, the book is a fascinating and sophisticated account of the ways two conspicuous identities have fundamentally informed one another. <i>Art and Homosexuality</i> discusses many of modernism's canonical figures--painters like Courbet, Picasso, and Pollock; writers like Whitman and Stein--and issues, such as the rise of abstraction, the avant-garde's relationship to its patrons and the political exploitation of art. It shows that many of the core ideas that define modernism are nearly indecipherable without an understanding of the paired identities of artist and homosexual. Illustrated with over 175 b/w and color images that range from high to popular culture and from Ancient Greece to contemporary America, <i>Art and Homosexuality</i> punctures the platitudes surrounding discussions of both aesthetics and sexual identity and takes our understanding of each in stimulating new directions. <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Author Q&amp;A with Christopher Reed</strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Arrow Shirt Collar advertisement, J.C. Leyendecker, 1910.<br>Photo courtesy of Archives of the American Illustrators Gallery, New York.</td> </tr> <tr> </tr> </tbody></table> <p></p> <p></p> <b>Q:</b> Sexuality in art is a very personal thing, expressed and interpreted in many different ways. What does sexuality in art mean to you?<p></p> <b>A:</b> That depends on what you mean by "personal." It's true, of course, we all experience our own erotic and aesthetic emotions personally, but they are experienced in relation to other people or things. And the categories of "sexuality" and "art" are social and collective. Different cultures create and develop them in different ways. The book is about those patterns.<p></p> One of the primary ways our culture has defined art and sexuality is as expressions of individualism &#x2013; that is as "personal." Our culture puts huge &#x2013; probably historically unprecedented &#x2013; value on the idea of individualism. Because we have made art and sexuality primary markers of individualism, they are enormously important to our culture. Just look at the expenditures of time and money we devote to them &#x2013; and at the intense pleasures and frustrations they bring us.But if we look at how tastes change--tastes in sex and in art--we see that they do so across cultures. It's paradoxical but true: Our sense of what individualism is is shared and collective.<p></p> What this book does is trace the way modern culture conjoined the kinds of individualism represented by the "artist" and the "homosexual" so that these were seen as closely interrelated types: outsiders, sensitive to aesthetics, who gravitated to cities and shocked conventional sensibilities by acting on their unconventional impulses.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Will any of the artists in the book surprise people?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Well I suppose that depends on how easily surprised people are! There are a lot of heavy hitters in the book, from Michelangelo to Andy Warhol. Maybe people will be surprised by the not-homosexual artists who play a role in the history the book lays out, people like Marcel Duchamp and George Segal. It's really no exaggeration to say that virtually every modern artist had to deal with ideas about homosexuality in some way because of the stereotypes that became so powerful about artists being gay. So almost any artists could be included.<p></p> What I think might surprised people more is the range of "art" included in the book, which stretches from Native American weavings to European glassware to modern magazine advertising.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> How much is censorship a part of the history and present of homosexuality in art? Does any particular period stand out as being more or less conservative?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Censorship is a tricky term. There are the very obvious cases of censorship, like when the Speaker of the House phones up the Smithsonian and demands the removal of David Wojnarowicz's video, A Fire in My Belly, from the Hide/Seek show recently. Those episodes are probably the least dangerous kinds of censorship. For one thing, they result in the supposedly censored image being much more widely circulated (through the news media, on the web, etc.) than it ever would have been without the censorship.<p></p> What is far more pernicious than such overt censorship are the subtler forms of self-censorship practiced by museums, commercial art galleries, and individual artists. To return to the example of the recent controversy over Wojnarowicz's A Fire in My Belly video, some of the museums that rushed to purchase and display the video once it was in the news for being censored had themselves refused to take the Hide/Seek exhibition, which was the first major museum exhibition in the US to focus on sexual identity as such. No major museum would touch this topic for a show. It was simply too controversial. And the same thinking excluded art that dealt with non-normative sexuality from lots of smaller shows at museums and galleries everywhere. And the same thinking makes commercial galleries turn away from art that deals with the politics of sexual identity. And that makes artists self-censor, both in their art and in the kinds of things they think and say about their art. I have examples of these dynamics in the book.<p></p> When you have an art world that constantly claims to be promoting and celebrating artistic individualism, but it has ruled expressions of any kind of politics of identity out of bounds, that's dangerous. Beyond its implications for artistic innovation, it limits everyone's ability to think about the possible range of their individual desires, passions, and pleasures.<p></p> And I would say that right now is one of the most conservative eras for that kind of censorship. It's hard to recognize, because we can't see things that are not being made, or not shown. And it's hard to think about ideas that are not being discussed. But these dynamics are very clear if we look back to the 1990s, when the art world--because of AIDS--was engaging these issues, and that engagement was rapidly shut down, not just by political conservatives but by academics and critics associated with the avant-garde. The chapter in my book on that gives some really egregious examples quoting people like Hal Foster who continue to be very influential in the contemporary art world today.<p></p><br><strong>Christopher Reed</strong> is Associate Professor of English and Visual Culture at Pennsylvania State University.

Scholars have struggled to explain this seeming contradiction. Helene Foley shows how Greek tragedy uses gender relations to explore specific issues in the development of the social, political, and intellectual life in the polis. She investigates three central and problematic areas in which tragic heroines act independently of men: death ritual and lamentation, marriage, and the making of significant ethical choices. Her anthropological approach, together with her literary analysis, allows for an unusually rich context in which to understand gender relations in ancient Greece.</p><br><p> This book examines, for example, the tragic response to legislation regulating family life that may have begun as early as the sixth century. It also draws upon contemporary studies of virtue ethics and upon feminist reconsiderations of the Western ethical tradition. Foley maintains that by viewing public issues through the lens of the family, tragedy asks whether public and private morality can operate on the same terms. Moreover, the plays use women to represent significant moral alternatives. Tragedy thus exploits, reinforces, and questions cultural clich�s about women and gender in a fashion that resonates with contemporary Athenian social and political issues.</p></p><p><p>"Helene Foley's book is exemplary in its use of a variety of approaches and it casts new light on both familiar and unfamiliar aspects of the tragic texts and Greek culture. Her treatment of myth, ritual, and dramatic plot, for example, is much richer and more nuanced than readings that have looked almost exclusively at the patriarchal aspects of the representation of women. Written in a fashion that is accessible to nonspecialists, this book will interest anthropologists, philosophers specializing in ethics, and scholars of gender studies--as well as classicists."<b>--Donald J. Mastronarde, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"An important book that will become the standard starting point for studying the representation of female characters in Greek tragedy. Many readers will be relieved to find that the family does after all provide opportunities for worthwhile moral agency on the part of its female members, and that Greek tragedy can be enjoyed and appreciated for its constructive critique, not its reinforcement, of classical Greek political and social inequities. This book should be read by specialists and general readers interested in drama, gender issues, and Greek civilization."<b>--Mark Griffith, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"This book will rank with Segal's <i>Tragedy and Civilization</i> as one of the most important works on tragedy in this century.

Sch�nbucher is a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, and has degrees in mathematics from Oxford University and a PhD in economics from Bonn University. He has taught various training courses organized by ICM and CIFT, and lectured at risk conferences for practitioners on credit derivatives pricing, credit risk modeling, and implementation.</p></p><p>Since its inception, the market for credit derivatives has shown impressive growth and is expected to hit a volume of more than $4.8 trillion by 2004. Credit derivatives have begun to transform modern banking; they have become a standard instrument for the management of default risk; they are being used for risk management and hedging as well as for speculation, balance-sheet management and regulatory capital purposes. <p>Despite their great usefulness, even established professionals often feel insecure when it comes to the quantitative analysis of the prices and risks of credit derivatives. Confronted with a bewildering variety of fundamentally different pricing approaches, it can be very challenging to understand their relative advantages and disadvantages and to choose the "correct" one for the problem at hand.</p> <p>In this book, the author carefully explains the different pricing models for credit derivatives in a very application-oriented way. Based on his wide experience in professional training for credit derivatives analysis, the models are developed with a view to their application to real pricing problems rather than just presenting the theory.</p> <p>Philipp Sch�nbucher is one of the most talented researchers of his generation. He has taken the Credit Derivatives world by storm. In this book he carefully explains the concepts and the mathematics behind all of the most important and popular credit risk models. Professor Sch�nbucher has filled an important gap on the quantitative finance bookshelf. &#x2013;Paul Wilmott</p> <p>The reader is presented with a clear, concise and readable treatment of credit pricing models that will appeal to practitioners and academics. It provides a useful roadmap to the many daily challenges that face practitioners. It will become a standard reference.<br> &#x2013;Stuart M. Turnbull, Senior Vice President, Fixed Income Research, Lehman Brothers, NY</p> <p>"This is the most comprehensive, and also the clearest, book on the details of constructing credit risk models that I have read. Throughout, it is directly useful for general value-at-risk credit modelling as well as its stated focus of credit derivatives. Readability is greatly enhanced by its step-by-step organization across what has grown to be a large topic area and the focus of its single author, as opposed to a collection of disjointed papers. Alternative modelling frameworks are written in a common notation and the reader is given all the details needed for direct implementation. The author, Philipp Sch�nbucher, is clearly one of the top researchers in this area, even before the writing of this book." &#x2013;Greg M Gupton, DefaultRisk.com</p> <p>"Philipp addresses a wide range of modelling issues in the fast growing market of credit derivatives. He covers a broad spectrum of topics starting with the simple everyday trading tools while gradually building up to the more complex mathematical models. It successfully bridges the gap between academia and practice in an elegant and easy style, making it a valuable book for a wide audience" &#x2013;Ebbe Rogge, Product Development Group, Financial Markets, ABN AMRO<br> </p>In this book, Philipp Sch�nbucher covers all the important modelling approaches from hedge-based pricing to stochastic-intensity models, credit rating models and firm's value based models, concluding with a large chapter on portfolio credit risk models. The author builds the models starting from simple basic models, introducing complexity only where it is needed, and explaining implementation, data collection and calibration on the way. The advantages and disadvantages of the different pricing approaches are clearly confronted, and the effects of hidden assumptions on the output of the models are identified.<p>The book is an indispensable tool for credit derivatives traders, quantitative analysts, software developers, risk managers, regulators, auditors, and anybody interested in how credit derivatives are priced.<br></p></p><h2>Opening: Collected Writings of William Segal 1985-1997</h2><p>&#34;Opening&#34; is intended for those who wish to know themselves, who want to understand better the human structure, its limitations, and its possibilities. Its aim is to prepare one for a more intelligent, to show a way toward fulfulling one&#39;s role as a true human being. It takes its wisdom from the work of G.I. Gurdjieff (d. 1949), the mystic who inspired artists and thinkers in the areas of philosophy, esotericism, dance, yoga, music and art. The writer and director Peter Brook made a film of Gurdjieff&#39;s most famous work, &#34;Meetings with Remarkable Men&#34; in 1976. Segal himself has been the subject of two films by American documentary maker Ken Burns, whose credits include television series, &#34;The American West&#34; and &#34;The Civil War&#34;.</p><p>After years of quietude, several of the foremost students of famed mystic G.I. Gurdjieff or of his ideas have recently published books dealing in some measure with Gurdjieff's teaching, popularly known as "the Work." Last year saw John Pentland's Exchanges Within, and this year has come Peter Brook's autobiography, Threads of Time. Here is another, and quite extraordinary, presentation of one Gurdjieff student's understanding of spiritual search. Segal, judging by this book, is unusual not only for the subtlety and depth of his knowledge, and for his ability to manifest it through a variety of media--the book contains essays, aphorisms, prose poems, paintings and records of conversation (three interviews)--but also for his ability to relate comprehensions both Western (the initial essay, "Opening," begins with a quotation by Meister Eckhart) and Eastern (Zen influences abound) into his meditations, which seem guided primarily by Gurdjieff's monumental synthesis of Eastern and Western spiritualities. Each page in this volume offers a hint, an encouragement, a remembrance of a more profound level of awareness, perhaps attainable even while engaged in an act so heady as reading: "Quietly watching, anticipating nothing, I am open to what is here, now," Segal writes. "I look at myself reading these words.... Will the fragility of my attention survive the experience of turning this page?" Likely not; but the possibility, Segal artfully shows, may be actualized; and those who wish for that will find remarkable support in his beautifully composed words and pictures, which give a strong sense of truth, of having arisen from what Segal refers to as "the silence which is present in the stillness" within. <p></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Finance Capital: A Study in the Latest Phase of Capitalist Development (Economic History)</h2><p>This is the first English translation of one of the classical works of Marxist economic theory. When Rudolf Hilferding&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Finance Capital was first published in 1919 it was acclaimed by reviewers as a continuation of Marx&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Capital, and it has a major influence upon subsequent Marxist thought, especially in the analysis of imperialism where it provided some of the fundamental ideas for the theories of Bukharin and Lenin. But Hilferding&#x20ac;&#x2122;s work was much more than a study of imperialism, which was presented only in the last section of the book. It set out to examine the main tendencies in the development of the capitalist mode of production as a whole at the beginning of the twentieth century, beginning with an exposition of the theory of money (in which particular attention was paid to the growth of credit money), then analysing the increasingly important role of the banks in the mobilization of capital, along with the development of large corporations, c</p><p></p><h2>The Neural Basis of Motor Control</h2><p>This authoritative study synthesizes physiology, neuroanatomy, kinesiology, and psychology in a thorough introduction to motor control. Readers will learn how the nervous system processes information, how the brain learns from previous experience and self-adjusts, and how behavioral intent is fitted into the circumstances of the moment. Throughout the book, the author considers questions of adaptation, motor learning, and guidance by the limbic system. Superbly illustrated and highlighted by many clinical examples, this volume is a clear, up-to-date account of motor control for students and professionals in the neurosciences, physical and occupational therapy, rehabilitation medicine, and kinesiology.</p><p>Vernon B. Brooks, Professor of Physiology, University of Western Ontario."A timely and important text....Can serve as a textbook for a complete course on motor control as well as a useful general reference for researchers in a variety of disciplines. Brooks has succeeded in presenting an overview of the field and has also given us a sense of the current theories<br>and controversies, a testimonial to both his vast knowledge of the field and to his clarity of presentation....This volume contains a wealth of information that can be of value to basic researchers, clinicians, and others interested in movement and movement disorders." --The Yale Journal of Biology<br>and Medicine<br><br>"A most useful book about motor control which is informative and up to date . . . Professor Brooks succeeds in his aim to provide a useful account for those in the health and allied professions with a professional interest in the management and treatment of patients with motor disorders."<br>--Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology<br><br>"Succeeds admirably....This is the most lucid and succinct introduction to the field of motor control. If you have been waiting for the basic book that will introduce you to the field of motor control, this is it." --Somatics<br><br>"The information provided is very impressive."--JoAnn Kluzik, Boston University</p><h2>In the Company of Bears: What Black Bears Have Taught Me about Intelligence and Intuition</h2><p><p>In <em>In the Company of Bears</em>, originally published in hardcover as <em>Out on a Limb</em>, Ben Kilham invites us into the world he has come to know best: the world of black bears.</p> <p>For decades, Kilham has studied wild black bears in a vast tract of Northern New Hampshire woodlands. At times, he has also taken in orphaned infants&#x2013;feeding them, walking them through the forest for months to help them decipher their natural world, and eventually reintroducing them back into the wild. Once free, the orphaned bears still regard him as their mother. And one of these bears, now a 17-year-old female, has given him extraordinary access to her daily life, opening a rare window into how she and the wild bears she lives among carry out their daily lives, raise their young, and communicate.</p> <p>Witnessing this world has led to some remarkable discoveries. For years, scientists have considered black bears to be mostly solitary. Kilham's observations, though, reveal the extraordinary interactions wild bears have with each other. They form friendships and alliances; abide by a code of conduct that keeps their world orderly; and when their own food supplies are ample, they even help out other bears in need. Could these cooperative behaviors, he asks, mimic behavior that existed in the animal that became human? In watching bears, do we see our earliest forms of communications unfold?</p> <p>Kilham's dyslexia once barred him from getting an advanced academic degree, securing funding for his research, and publishing his observations in the scientific literature. After being shunned by the traditional scientific community, though, Kilham&#x2019;s unique findings now interest bear researchers worldwide. His techniques even aid scientists working with pandas in China and bears in Russia. Moreover, the observation skills that fueled Kilham&#x2019;s exceptional work turned out to be born of his dyslexia. His ability to think in pictures and decipher systems makes him a unique interpreter of the bear's world.</p> <p><em>In the Company of Bears</em> delivers Kilham&#x2019;s fascinating glimpse at the inner world of bears, and also makes a passionate case for science, and education in general, to open its doors to different ways of learning and researching&#x2013;doors that could lead to far broader realms of discovery.</p></p><p><p>Ben Kilham has been researching and living with black bears for nearly twenty years. He has become an expert in black bear behavior, as well as in rehabilitating orphaned and injured bears and reintroducing them to the wild.&nbsp; He is invited to lecture all over the United States and internationally.&nbsp; His previous book is <em>Among the Bears, Raising Orphan Cubs in the Wild&nbsp;</em> Kilham and his work with black bears have been featured in five internationally televised documentaries, including National Geographic and Discovery Channel features, and he has appeared on <em>The Today Show, Good Morning America, ABC Nightly News, ABC Nightly News International, The O&#x2019;Reilly Factor, Fox News Daytime Edition, Inside Edition, The David Letterman Show, NBC Nightline, CBS Coast to Coast, Canadian Broadcasting Company Nightly News</em>, and various other shows, as well as National Public Radio, and a host of nationally broadcast radio shows. He lives in Lyme, New Hampshire.</p><p><strong>Kirkus Reviews&#x2014; </strong></p> <p>"The author is a state-sponsored researcher whose work with the black bear population in northern New Hampshire is safe, methodical and sanctioned. Since he does not currently hold a doctorate&#x2014;he&#x2019;s now working on that&#x2014;much of his fieldwork has been discounted by the scientific community. On the other hand, his outsider status has allowed him to go his own way and trust in his natural skills rather than bemoan his shortcomings revolving around his dyslexia. Despite his condition, he is blessed with the ability to recognize patterns and see systems where they are not self-evident. The tone of his presentation allays criticism or hostility with its frankness and generosity, as he plunges into what he has observed: how bears use scent and body language, how they compete and cooperate, how they enforce house rules and exhibit a social code of justice and punishment, and how they communicate. Though he has interacted with hundreds of black bears, one in particular&#x2014;Squirty, whom he adopted as a cub and released into the wild&#x2014;has allowed Kilham to experience an intimate association with him, from comfort to anger and many other emotions in between. The author presents a solid case for bears as primal actors of social exchange&#x2014;cooperation, altruism, morality&#x2014;and their study, a 'gateway' to understanding 'how surplus fitness and an increase in population density have affected human behavior.' A powerfully original study of bears."</p><br><br><p><strong>Booklist&nbsp;&#x2015; </strong></p> <p>"For nearly 20 years, naturalist Kilham has fostered orphaned black bear cubs in northern New Hampshire. In his previous book, Among the Bears, Raising Orphan Cubs in the Wild (2002), he described his early efforts to teach cubs to forage, hunt, and avoid natural and human-made dangers. In this book, he recounts years of studying bears he released into the woods, especially Squirty, who has successfully raised her own cubs, who have in turn raised another generation of wild bears. Because Squirty still trusts Kilham as family, he has been able to observe bear social interactions closely. Among his discoveries are that bears socialize far more than commonly believed and occasionally exhibit altruistic behavior. Although some scientists criticize Kilham&#x2019;s work, he defends his methods and likens bear society to that of primitive humans, suggesting that we can learn much about our origins from the bears. Advice for hikers encountering bears rounds out this popular-science memoir."</p><br><br><p><strong>Library Journal &#x2015; </strong></p> <p>"Animal behaviorists like Kilham (Among the Bears) are at a disadvantage in the world of science: they observe their animals in nature rather than in the lab. Severely dyslexic, Kilham was denied admission to a doctoral program: that, too, made his work suspect. But he&#x2019;s raised 27 orphan bears from infancy and been friends to one bear for 14 years now. Kilham even discovered a sensory organ in black bears that helps them to determine which plants are safe to eat. In straightforward prose, Kilham sets forth what he&#x2019;s learned from more than 20 years of working with bears. They aren&#x2019;t loners, as thought, but inhabit a complicated world of reciprocal social arrangements that allow them to browse other bears&#x2019; territories when food is scarce in their own. They read mood and intent and discipline bears that transgress. Kilham speculates on the relevance of his observations to early human development and sees bears&#x2019; behavior as a possible analog to ours. VERDICT Anyone who enjoys reading works by Temple Grandin (who provides the foreword here), Jane Goodall, or Frans de Waal will enjoy this book. Kilham is a worthy member of a small but increasingly vocal confraternity of scientists who watch as often as they count."</p><br><br><p>"Magnificent! <em>In the Company of Bears</em> is a brilliant read. Kilham perfectly exemplifies how much the world has to gain from the exceptional insights of dyslexic individuals, who often possess a special talent for finding order hidden in the complex patterns of the real world. We cannot recommend this book highly enough."<strong>--Brock and Fernette Eide, authors of <em>The Dyslexic Advantage</em>&nbsp; </strong></p><br><br><p>"Kilham's latest is the most thought-provoking book that I've read about bears. It not only made me think differently about black bears, it also enriched how I feel about them."<strong>--Stephen Herrero, biologist and author of <em>Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"No one knows black bears like Ben Kilham does. During the past decade alone he has raised and rehabilitated to the wild more than 100 orphaned cubs. The social code of the bears, as so delightfully described in <em>In the Company of Bears</em>, includes cooperation, imitation, fairness, punishment for infraction, reciprocity, and other traits of this solitary yet highly social species. Human parallels are drawn, too. The charm and core of the book lie in its anecdotes and unique insights, especially of the female Squirty with whom Ben has had a friendship for more than seventeen years. Read this fascinating book and see the bear's world with new eyes."<strong>--George Schaller, author of <em>The Last Panda</em>; science director, Wildlife Conservation Society</strong></p><br><br><p>"<em>In the Company of Bears</em> is a brilliant revelation about black bears and a paean to human potential. After decades spent caring for orphan bears and releasing them into the wild, Ben Kilham, a dyslexic animal lover, has now summarized what he has learned about their rich social complexity and humanlike intentionality. The result is to turn a supposedly familiar species into a creature of unsuspected acuity. Part science, part intuition, this enticing natural history is a provocative argument about animal minds, and an intimate celebration of life in the New Hampshire woods."<strong>--Richard Wrangham, author of <em>Catching Fire: How Cooking Made us Human</em>; co-director of the Kibale Chimpanzee Project</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>In the Company of Bears</em> by Benjamin Kilham is one of the finest books on the natural history of an animal that I have ever read. As gripping as the best novel, it is very readable and provides great insights into the mind of the black bear and the human. The research that Kilham has done on the behavior of black bears is groundbreaking and will lead us to a much better understanding of the development of intelligence in mammals and the evolution of cognition throughout the animal world."<strong>--James R. Spotila, Betz Chair Professor of Environmental Science, Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science, Drexel University; author of <em>Saving Sea Turtles</em></strong></p> <p><em><br> <br> </em>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>"Like Jane Goodall&#x2019;s studies of chimps, Ben Kilham&#x2019;s work with black bears is more than just revealing: it&#x2019;s revolutionary. This riveting book supports two astonishing conclusions:&nbsp; that bears are far more sophisticated than most scientists dared imagine, and that dyslexia, once considered a failing, may simply be another, and often valuable, way of thinking. Ben&#x2019;s work will transform our understanding of&nbsp; how animals live--and how science should be done."<strong>--Sy Montgomery, author of <em>Walking with the Great Apes</em> and <em>Search for the Golden Moon Bear</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Ben Kilham's <em>In the Company of Bears </em>is surely the most&nbsp; insightful book about animals written in the last 100 years. His observation of black bears is the best ever done, his data is flawless, and these attributes have created a landmark of science that as far as I know has not been equalled with any other species. And if that&#x2019;s not enough, it&#x2019;s also a page-turner and a must-read. It left me breathless."<strong>--Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, author of <em>The Hidden Life of Dogs </em>and<em> The Tribe of Tiger</em></strong></p></p><h2>Everyone&#39;s an Author with Readings</h2><p><p><strong>A rhetoric that bridges the gap between the writing students already do in social media and other nonacademic contexts and the writing they&#x2019;re expected to do in college&#x2015;all within a strong rhetorical framework.</strong></p> Built on the keystones of rhetoric, <em>Everyone&#x2019;s an Author</em> provides a strong foundation for authoring in the digital age: in college essays, but also on Twitter; in print, but also online; with words, but also with sound, video, and images.

The novel traces the struggles of Rhoda, her family, and her suitor to come to terms with the implications of Rhoda&#x2019;s heritage. Howells employs this stock situation to explore the newly urgent questions of identity, morality, and social policy raised by &#x201c;miscegenation&#x201d; in the post-Reconstruction United States. The novel imagines interracial marriage sympathetically at a time when racist sentiment was on the rise, and does this in one of Howells&#x2019;s most aesthetically economical performances in the short novel form. </p> <p> Appendices to this Broadview Edition include material on the &#x201c;tragic mulatta&#x201d; in literature, interracial marriage, the &#x201c;science&#x201d; of race in the nineteenth century, and Howells&#x2019;s literary realism. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Paul R.

David M. Lubin presents a highly original examination of the era's fine arts and entertainment to show how they ranged from patriotic idealism to profound disillusionment. <br><br>In stylishly written chapters, Lubin assesses the war's impact on two dozen painters, designers, photographers, and filmmakers from 1914 to 1933. He considers well-known figures such as Marcel Duchamp, John Singer Sargent, D. W. Griffith, and the African American outsider artist Horace Pippin while resurrecting forgotten artists such as the mask-maker Anna Coleman Ladd, the sculptor Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, and the combat artist Claggett Wilson. The book is liberally furnished with illustrations from epoch-defining posters, paintings, photographs, and films. Armed with rich cultural-historical details and an interdisciplinary narrative approach, David Lubin creatively upends traditional understandings of the Great War's effects on the visual arts in America.<br></p><p><br><strong>David M.

Lubin's inclusion of visual culture examples falling outside of the traditional fine arts makes this book particularly appealing and rich." -- <em>ARLIS/NA Reviews</em> <br><p></p><br>"...a sustained and meticulous examination of the various impulses that shaped the US's diverse visual promotion and interpretation of WW I. Focusing on the period from 1914-33, Lubin provides a comprehensive examination of almost every mode of visual representation--paintings, posters, sculpture, films, even animated films--and the men and women who created them...Noting racial, sexual, and gender themes, Lubin demonstrates a profoundly distinctive talent for establishing the historical context and the intellectual, political, and social antecedents of the works. Beautifully illustrated and including extensive chapter notes, the volume is encyclopedic in the scope of subjects and themes it examines in the pursuit of understanding the visual rhetoric that portrayed and supported the war. No student of the cultural, intellectual, and artistic history of WW I and its aftermath can ignore this perceptive, engaging analysis." -- <em>CHOICE</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Grand Illusions</em> is a remarkable work of scholarship and cultural criticism. The huge amount of material Lubin has gathered makes absolutely clear the widespread and profound effect World War I had on those who created masses of art about it. Considered as a whole, <em>Grand Illusions</em> may come close to being the definitive study of America's myriad 'Illusions' about the Great War. Many others have addressed the topic, but no one does it better than Lubin in this fine volume." -- Townsend Ludington, author of <em>Marsden Hartley: The Biography of an American Artist</em> <br><p></p><br>"What Paul Fussell's <em>The Great War and Modern Memory</em> did for literature, David Lubin's <em>Grand Illusions</em> does for the painting, photography, sculpture, and film inspired by the First World War.

Unlike a house, the barn is chaste. For this is a place for work&#x2014;a space rubbed by livestock and worn by labor. The repeating patterns of the posts and beams, now considered impediments to efficient farming, mask the very intricacy that gives old barns their intrinsic character. Many of these splendid spaces now lie empty, festooned with cobwebs, awaiting collapse, but there is a growing recognition that these honestly framed buildings can lend themselves to transformation and a new purpose. <br><br> In the decade-plus time since <i>BARN: The Art of a Working Building</i> was published, there has been a remarkable growth in the different ways that barns can be preserved and reinvigorated. There are many great barns that may not survive, and many problems with others still standing that remain with their integrity intact, but action is being taken. <br><br> <i>BARN: Preservation &amp; Adaptation&nbsp;</i>chronicles and expands upon the progress being made, emphasizing the variety of imaginative uses that can revive these beloved structures. With more than 400 exciting photographs, drawings, and plans, and a lively text by the same team of expert barn restoration practitioners who brought you <i>BARN<i>: The Art of a Working Building</i></i>, here are accounts of barns as retreats, studios, shops, meeting places, inns, restaurants, galleries, and museums&#x2014;even sheltering swimming pools&#x2014;showing the conversion to domestic use, and barns as barns again. The story, rich in historical detail, covers the problems of reinterpretation and barn culture informatively and critically, yet with great optimism and enthusiasm. The true companion to its highly successful predecessor, this book will delight all those who love and want to explore these grand monuments.</p><p><b>David Larkin</b> is a book designer, editor, and art director who has traveled the country over the past decade working on his visual book documentaries that record American history through its buildings, vernacular architecture, rural life, material culture, and design.

Huggins Lectures)</h2><p><p>The three most important Supreme Court Justices before the Civil War&#x2015;Chief Justices John Marshall and Roger B. Taney and Associate Justice Joseph Story&#x2015;upheld the institution of slavery in ruling after ruling. These opinions cast a shadow over the Court and the legacies of these men, but historians have rarely delved deeply into the personal and political ideas and motivations they held. In <i>Supreme Injustice</i>, the distinguished legal historian Paul Finkelman establishes an authoritative account of each justice&#x2019;s proslavery position, the reasoning behind his opposition to black freedom, and the incentives created by circumstances in his private life.</p><p>Finkelman uses census data and other sources to reveal that Justice Marshall aggressively bought and sold slaves throughout his lifetime&#x2015;a fact that biographers have ignored. Justice Story never owned slaves and condemned slavery while riding circuit, and yet on the high court he remained silent on slave trade cases and ruled against blacks who sued for freedom. Although Justice Taney freed many of his own slaves, he zealously and consistently opposed black freedom, arguing in <i>Dred Scott </i>that free blacks had no Constitutional rights and that slave owners could move slaves into the Western territories. Finkelman situates this infamous holding within a solid record of support for slavery and hostility to free blacks.</p><p><i>Supreme Injustice</i> boldly documents the entanglements that alienated three major justices from America&#x2019;s founding ideals and embedded racism ever deeper in American civic life.</p></p><p>Paul Finkelman is President of Gratz College.&#x201c;[<i>Supreme Injustice</i>] tells the story of three United States Supreme Court Justices...and their &#x2018;slavery jurisprudence.&#x2019; Each of these men, Finkelman argues...shared the belief that antislavery agitation undermined the legal and political structures instituted by the Constitution... Finkelman insists that the legacy of Marshall, Story, and Taney had enormous implications...strengthening the institutions of slavery and embedding in the law a systemic hostility to fundamental freedom and basic justice. These are strong allegations... Yet the evidence adds up... Finkelman remains an important voice in legal education and has pushed scholarly conversations about slavery in new directions.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Allen Mendenhall</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Taken together, Finkelman&#x2019;s accounts of the troubling underbellies of the Marshall, Story and Taney careers offer an unsettling meal...This book is a useful contribution toward a fleshing out of the lives of three men who shaped the bulk of American law in the formative years between our independence and our descent into civil war.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Wecht</b><b>, </b><b><i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Supreme Injustice</i> contains no call to topple monuments or to rewrite history books.

Nelson and Kenneth C. Kemp, both of The University of Nevada. This manual contains 43 finely tuned experiments chosen to introduce students to basic lab techniques and to il�lustrate core chemical principles. Pre-lab questions and post-lab questions have been revised and include detachable report sheets. Safety and disposal information has been expanded and includes waste management information. This new edi�tion has been revised to correlate more tightly with the text.</p><p><p> Presenting a total of 41 finely tuned experiments that have been tested by thousands of students, this comprehensive manual teaches students basic laboratory techniques, reviews chemical concepts, helps students identify different chemical substances, and helps students learn to think like scientists. </p> <p> Each experiment: </p> <ul> <li>States learning objectives</li> <li>Lists apparatus and chemicals needed for that particular experiment</li> <li>Describes what the experiment will prove</li> <li>Highlights and safety disposal information</li> <li>Provides step-by-step procedures</li> <li>Poses preliminary questions and emphasizes important take-away points</li> <li>Concludes with report sheets for answering questions and tabulating results</li> </ul><p> Most students who take freshman chemistry are not planning for a career in this discipline. As a result, the introductory chemistry course usually serves several functions at various levels. It begins the training process for those who seek to become chemists. It introduces nonscience students to chemistry as an important, useful, and, we hope, interesting and rewarding part of their general education. It also should stimulate those students who are seeking the intellectual challenges and sense of purpose they hope to obtain from a career. </p> <p> This manual has been written with these objectives in mind and to accompany the ninth edition of the text <i>Chemistry: The Central Science</i> by Theodore L. Brown, H. Eugene LeMay, Jr., and Bruce E. Bursten. Each of the experiments is self-contained, with sufficient background material to conduct and understand the experiment. Each has a pedagogical objective to exemplify one or more specific principles. Because the experiments are self-contained, they may be undertaken in any order; however, we have found for our General Chemistry course that the sequence of Experiments 1 through 7 provides the firmest background and introduction. </p> <p> To assist the student, we have included review questions to be answered before the experiments are begun. These are designed both to help the student understand the experiment and as an incentive to read the experiment in advance. As a further incentive, answers to some of these questions are provided in Appendix J. </p> <p> We have made an effort to minimize the cost of the experiments. We have at the same time striven for a broad representation of the essential principles while keeping in mind that many students gain no other exposure to analytical techniques. Consequently, balances, pH meters, and spectrophotometers are used in some of the experiments. A list of necessary materials is given at the beginning of each experiment. </p> <p> Each of the experiments contains a detachable report sheet that is easily graded, and most experiments contain unknowns. Very few of the experiments may be "dry-labbed." </p> <p> In this ninth edition we have: </p> <ul> <li>carefully edited all experiments for accuracy, safety, and cost</li> <li>expanded experiment 1 to include a density measurement</li> <li>added more instructions about waste disposal</li> <li>added more helpful hints to instructors in the Annotated Instructor's Edition (AIE)</li> <li>modified many of the review questions</li> </ul></p><h2>Political Science: An Introduction</h2><p>Balancing practical and theoretical knowledge, Political Science is a comprehensive and jargon-free introduction to the field&#x2019;s basic concepts and themes.

The story is told with text and graphics and accompanied with Zhuying (phonetic annotation). A reading guide of this Hemingway classic helps young readers develop their writing skills. In Traditional Chinese. Distributed by Tsai Fong Books, Inc.</p><p>Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honor to the author. In fact <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers as <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that "no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords." Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: <blockquote> Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. </blockquote> If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: "The old man was dreaming about the lions." Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. <i>--James Marcus</i>2 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Music in China: Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture Includes CD (Global Music Series)</h2><p><em>Music in China</em> is one of many case-study volumes that can be used along with <em>Thinking Musically</em>, the core book in the <strong>Global Music Series.</strong> <em>Thinking Musically</em> incorporates music from many diverse cultures and establishes the framework for exploring the practice of music around the world. It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present. Visit www.oup.com/us/globalmusic for a list of case studies in the Global Music Series. The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study.<br> <em>Music in China</em> offers a unique exploration of the rich, dynamic, and multifaceted Chinese musical landscape. In contrast with previous scholarship--which focused almost exclusively on the role of music in elite culture--this volume takes a balanced look at a variety of traditional and modern genres, including those performed among local and regional folk musicians, in academia, in the media, and on concert stages both inside and outside of China. Using the interrelated themes of identity, modernization, and ideology as a narrative framework, author Frederick Lau discusses the musical features of the selected genres, the processes through which they came into existence, and related socio-political issues. Lau draws on his own extensive fieldwork and performance experience in both mainland China and its diasporic communities to show how the ever-changing Chinese musical tradition takes on particular meanings in China, in overseas Chinese communities, and in diverse international settings.<br> Enhanced by eyewitness accounts of local performances, interviews with key performers, vivid illustrations, and hands-on listening activities, <em>Music in China</em> provides an accessible and engaging introduction to Chinese music. It is packaged with an 80-minute audio CD containing examples of the music discussed in the book.<br></p><p>Frederick Lau is an Associate Professor of Music at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.</p><h2>Soft Patriarchs, New Men: How Christianity Shapes Fathers and Husbands (Morality and Society Series)</h2><p>In the wake of dramatic, recent changes in American family life, evangelical and mainline Protestant churches took markedly different positions on family change. This work explains why these two traditions responded so differently to family change and then goes on to explore how the stances of evangelical and mainline Protestant churches toward marriage and parenting influenced the husbands and fathers that fill their pews.<br><br>According to W. Bradford Wilcox, the divergent family ideologies of evangelical and mainline churches do not translate into large differences in family behavior between evangelical and mainline Protestant men who are married with children. Mainline Protestant men, he contends, are "new men" who take a more egalitarian approach to the division of household labor than their conservative peers and a more involved approach to parenting than men with no religious affiliation. Evangelical Protestant men, meanwhile, are "soft patriarchs"&#x2014;not as authoritarian as some would expect, and given to being more emotional and dedicated to their wives and children than both their mainline and secular counterparts. Thus, Wilcox argues that religion domesticates men in ways that make them more responsive to the aspirations and needs of their immediate families.</p><p><b>W.

Recently conserved to its original glory, this magnificent suit of armor, made for a trusted courtier, diplomat, and commander of infantry units for the Habsburgs, deceives the eye: the steel sleeves drape in graceful folds, with cuts in the surface, suggesting the armor is made from cloth rather than metal. The author of this fascinating volume explores the question: why does the armor look this way?<br><br> Stefan Krause delves&nbsp;back five centuries to the political, social, and cultural context in which von Rogendorf lived. Among other key venues in the Holy Roman Empire, this story takes the reader to the court of Emperor Charles V in Spain and to&nbsp;Augsburg, the leading center of armor making, where&nbsp;Rogendorf was introduced to the court armorer of Charles V, Kolman Helmschmid (1471-1532). Helmschmid was famous for his inventive and masterfully sculptured works, and this book elaborates on his unique contributions to the history of armor, and how and why von Rogendorf's suit was informed by contemporary fashion. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Stefan Krause</b> is curator of the Imperial Armoury&nbsp;at the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna.&nbsp;</p><h2>Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy</h2><p><p> Muscle hypertrophy&#x2014;defined as an increase in muscular size&#x2014;is one of the primary outcomes of resistance training. <i>Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy </i>is a comprehensive compilation of science-based principles to help professionals develop muscle hypertrophy in athletes and clients. With more than 825 references and applied guidelines throughout, no other resource offers a comparable quantity of content solely focused on muscle hypertrophy. Readers will find up-to-date content so they fully understand the science of muscle hypertrophy and its application to designing training programs. </p><p> Written by Brad Schoenfeld, PhD, a leading authority on muscle hypertrophy, this text provides strength and conditioning professionals, personal trainers, sport scientists, researchers, and exercise science instructors with a definitive resource for information regarding muscle hypertrophy&#x2014;the mechanism of its development, how the body structurally and hormonally changes when exposed to stress, ways to most effectively design training programs, and current nutrition guidelines for eliciting hypertrophic changes. The full-color book offers several features to make the content accessible to readers: </p><p> � Research Findings sidebars highlight the aspects of muscle hypertrophy currently being examined to encourage readers to re-evaluate their knowledge and ensure their training practices are up to date. </p><p> � Practical Applications sidebars outline how to apply the research conclusions for maximal hypertrophic development. </p><p> � Comprehensive subject and author indexes optimize the book&#x2019;s utility as a reference tool. </p><p> � An image bank containing most of the art, photos, and tables from the text allows instructors and presenters to easily teach the material outlined in the book. </p><p> Although muscle hypertrophy can be attained through a range of training programs, this text allows readers to understand and apply the specific responses and mechanisms that promote optimal muscle hypertrophy in their athletes and clients. It explores how genetic background, age, sex, and other factors have been shown to mediate the hypertrophic response to exercise, affecting both the rate and the total gain in lean muscle mass. Sample programs in the text show how to design a three- or four-day-per-week undulating periodized program and a modified linear periodized program for maximizing muscular development. </p><p><i>Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy</i> is an invaluable resource for strength and conditioning professionals seeking to maximize hypertrophic gains and those searching for the most comprehensive, authoritative, and current research in the field. </p></p><p><p><b>Brad Schoenfeld, PhD, CSCS, CSPS, FNSCA</b>, is widely regarded as one of the leading strength and fitness experts in the United States.

This book continues to be the market leader due to its strategic approach, solid research base, comprehensive coverage, balanced examination of oral and written communication, and focus on managerial, not entry-level, competencies. In the <strong>Sixth Edition</strong>, author Geraldine E. Hynes preserves the book&#x2019;s key strengths while reflecting the realities of the contemporary workplace.</p><p><p><strong>Geraldine E. Hynes,</strong> PhD, is a professor in the College of Business Administration, Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas, USA, where she has taught business and managerial communication at the undergraduate and graduate levels since 2001.

In this groundbreaking study, noted Degas scholar Richard Kendall and Picasso expert Elizabeth Cowling present well-documented instances of Picasso&#x2019;s direct responses to Degas&#x2019;s work, as well as more conceptual and challenging affinities between their oeuvres. Richly illustrated essays explore the artists&#x2019; parallel interests in modern urban life, ballet dancers, activities such as bathing and combing the hair, photography, and the challenges of sculpture. The book also provides the first extended analysis of Picasso&#x2019;s engagement with Degas&#x2019;s art in his final years, when he acquired several of the French artist&#x2019;s brothel monotypes and reworked some of them in his own prints. Offering many fresh ideas and a significant amount of new material about two of the most popular and influential artists of the modern era, this handsome book promises to make a lasting contribution to the literature on both artists.</p></p><p><b>Elizabeth Cowling</b> is Professor Emeritus of History of Art at Edinburgh University, and an independent scholar and exhibition curator. <b>Richard Kendall</b> is Consultative Curator of Nineteenth-Century Art at the Clark, as well as an independent scholar and exhibition curator. <b>C�cile Godefroy</b> is a researcher at the Fundaci�n Almine y Bernard Ruiz-Picasso para el Arte in Madrid. <b>Sarah Lees</b> is Associate Curator of European Art at the Clark. <b>Montse Torras</b> is Exhibitions Coordinator at the Museu Picasso in Barcelona."The scholars present new connections between the artists' lives and reveal the extent to which the younger artist was fascinated by the elder's art and personality."&#x2014;Dylan Klempner, <i>Art New England</i> (Dylan Klempner <i>Art New England</i>)</p><h2>Unfinished business: The politics of &#39;dissident&#39; Irish republicanism</h2><p>This book discusses the development of &#39;dissident&#39; Irish republicanism and considers its impact on politics throughout Ireland since the 1980s. Based on a series of interviews with over ninety radical republican activists from the wide range of groups and currents which make up &#39;dissident&#39; republicanism, the book provides an up-to-date assessment of the political significance and potential of the groups who continue to oppose the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. It shows that the &#39;dissidents&#39; are much more than traditionalist irreconcilables left behind by Gerry Adams&#39; entry into the mainstream. Instead the book suggests that the dynamics and trajectory of &#39;dissident&#39; republicanism are shaped more by contemporary forces than historical tradition and that by understanding the &#34;dissidents&#34; we can better understand the emerging forms of political challenge in an age of austerity and increasing political instability internationally.</p><p>Marisa McGlinchey is Research Fellow in Political Science at the Centre for Trust, Peace and Social Relations at Coventry University"Dissident" Irish republicanism remains a phenomenon of enduring significance.

Richard English, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Queen's University Belfast and author of <i>Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA </i>'At a time of renewed Brexit-related political instability in Northern Ireland, McGlinchey has produced a timely and fascinating work. Anyone who has ever asked the question about "dissident" republicans - who are they and what do they think? - will find the answer here.

Lord Paul Bew, Professor of Irish Politics, Queen's University Belfast 'Among some of the most impressive aspects of this kaleidoscopic account of violent dissident Irish republicanism are the primary sources. The author deserves fulsome praise for conducting close to 100 individual interviews with the key actors. This alone is a remarkable feat, but combined with penetrating analysis and objective insight into very controversial subject matter, this book will stand the test of time as a history of one strand of republicanism that still stalks the peace process. <i>Unfinished Business</i> will be hard to match in terms of shining light into the dark corners of the armed republican tradition in Ireland - an illuminating and fascinating read.'

After reading the text, students will have a better appreciation of evaluation as a process that needs to be custom-fit to the situation. Throughout the book, Stake presents evaluation as a series of choices for the reader: - To remain independent or to join with program staff or stakeholders - To value personal experience as evidence or to shun it as biased - To aid development formatively or to assess the existing program summatively - To use issues, goals, gains, efficiency, or problem solving as the key conceptual structure - To invest small or large in trying out and validating data-gathering procedures - To support the standards and ethical codes of professional associations Standards-Based and Responsive Evaluation will prove an essential text for program evaluation courses in education, nursing, social work, psychology, sociology, communication, and anthropology. Experienced researchers and professional evaluators will also find this an invaluable reference for a more experiential, interpretive approach to evaluation work and policy setting.</p><p>Professor Stake received his B.A. in Mathematics with a minor in naval science and Spanish from the University of Nebraska in 1950. He graduated with an M.A. in educational psychology in 1954 from this university. In 1958, he received his Ph.D. in psychology from Princeton University. From 1955 to 1958, he was a Psychometric Fellow at the Educational Testing Service. Then, an Associate Professor and Faculty Research Coordinator of the College of Education at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. In 1963, he arrived at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he assisted Thomas Hastings, Lee Cronbach, and Jack Easley in the creation of the new evaluation center, CIRCE, and in developing a program of research on program evaluation. He also became the Associate Director of the Statewide High School Testing Program. In 1975, he became director of CIRCE. He has been active in the program evaluation profession and has promoted an approach to evaluation methods called &#34;responsive evaluation.&#34; He took up a qualitative perspective, particularly case study methods, in order to represent the personal experience and complexity of evaluation study. He received the Lazerfeld Award from the American Evaluation Association and an honorary doctorate from the University of Uppsala.We can be grateful that Dr. Stake decided to cap his distinguished career by sharing his ideas in writing. This is a book that evaluators will want to have in their personal library. It tells us a lot about our field, highlights contrasting ways of evaluating without pitting one against the other, and manages to remind us why many of us chose this line of work in the first place.

A silversmith prior to the Revolution and heralded for his patriotism during the war, Revere aspired to higher social status within the fledgling United States. To that end, he shifted away from artisan silversmithing toward larger, more involved manufacturing ventures such as ironworking, bronze casting, and copper sheet rolling. Drawing extensively on the Revere Family Papers, Martello explores Revere&#x2019;s vibrant career successes and failures, social networks, business practices, and the groundbreaking metallurgical technologies he developed and employed. Revere&#x2019;s commercial ventures epitomized what Martello terms <i>proto-industrialization</i>, a transitional state between craft work and mass manufacture that characterizes the broader, fast-changing landscape of the American economy. Martello uses Revere as a lens to view the social, economic, and technological milieu of early America while demonstrating Revere&#x2019;s pivotal role in both the American Revolution and the rise of industrial America.</p><p>Original and well told, this account argues that the greatest patriotic contribution of America's Midnight Rider was his work in helping the nation develop from a craft to an industrial economy.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert Martello</b> is an associate professor of the history of science and technology at the Franklin W.

This is the enigma at the heart of Janet Malcolm's riveting new book about a murder trial in the insular Bukharan-Jewish community of Forest Hills, Queens, that captured national attention. The defendant, Mazoltuv Borukhova, a beautiful young physician, is accused of hiring an assassin to kill her estranged husband, Daniel Malakov, a respected orthodontist, in the presence of their four-year old child. The prosecutor calls it an act of vengeance: just weeks before Malakov was killed in cold blood, he was given custody of Michelle for inexplicable reasons. It is the "Dickensian ordeal" of Borukhova's innocent child that drives Malcolm's inquiry. </p><p>With the intellectual and emotional precision for which she is known, Malcolm looks at the trial&#x2014;"a contest between competing narratives"&#x2014;from every conceivable angle. It is the chasm between our ideals of justice and the human factors that influence every trial&#x2014;from divergent lawyering abilities to the nature of jury selection, the malleability of evidence, and the disposition of the judge&#x2014;that is perhaps most striking. </p><p>Surely one of the most keenly observed trial books ever written, <i>Iphigenia in Forest Hills</i> is ultimately about character and "reasonable doubt."

After Knight's death, his half-brother sets out to penetrate the mystery of the famous English novelist's life, but he is impeded by the false, the distorted, the irrelevant. Yet the search proves to be a story quite as intriguing as any of Sebastian Knight's own books, as baffling, and, in the end, as uniquely rewarding. On one level, this literary detective story has pungent points to make about the role of the artist in a society basically hostile to the creative spirit. On another, <em>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</em> probes the essential problem of the ambiguity of human identity: Just who was Sebastian Knight?</p></p><p>"I am very happy that you liked that little book," wrote Vladimir Nabokov to Edmund Wilson in 1941. "As I think I told you, I wrote it five years ago, in Paris, on the implement called <i>bidet</i> as a writing desk--because we lived in one room and I had to use our small bathroom as a study." The book in question was <i>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</i>. And despite its humble origins, Nabokov's first novel in English showed him to be in absolute command of his adopted language.<p> Like many of the author's later triumphs, this one revolves around a question of identity. The late Sebastian Knight, we discover, was a transplanted Russian novelist whose taste for linguistic trickery bears a certain resemblance to Nabokov's. Now his half-brother is attempting to reconstruct the existence of this elusive figure. As he readily admits, the raw material isn't exactly the stuff of melodrama: "Sebastian's life, though far from being dull, lacked the terrific vigour of his literary style." But even the most mundane facts prove difficult for the narrator to nail down. He does, on the other hand, describe Sebastian's creative processes in exquisite and accurate detail: </p><blockquote> His struggle with words was usually painful and this for two reasons. One was the common one with writers of his type: the bridging of the abyss lying between expression and thought; the maddening feeling that the right words, the only words are awaiting you on the opposite bank in the misty distance, and the shudderings of the still unclothed thought clamouring for them on this side of the abyss. </blockquote> Sebastian's real life--or anybody's, for that matter--refuses to yield up a verbal equivalent. Still, the narrator manages a kind of fraternal fusion with his subject on the book's final page, which suggests a fluid and very Nabokovian view of identity itself. For this reason, and for the splendors of its prose, <i>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</i> is a necessary read. It's also safe to say that it's the very best novel ever written on a bidet. <i>--James Marcus</i>"Nabokov writes prose the only way it should be written, that is, ecstatically." -- John Updike <br>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight is a perversely magical literary detective story -- subtle, intricate, leading to a tantalizing climax -- about the mysterious life of a famous writer. Many people knew things about Sebastian Knight as a distinguished novelist, but probably fewer than a dozen knew of the two love affairs that so profoundly influenced his career, the second one in such a disastrous way. After Knight's death, his half brother sets out to penetrate the enigma of his life, starting with a few scanty clues in the novelist's private papers. His search proves to be a story as intriguing as any of his subject's own novels, as baffling, and, in the end, as uniquely rewarding.</p><h2>You Don&#39;t Have to Do It Alone: How to Involve Others to Get Things Done</h2><p>We all need to involve others to accomplish tasks and achieve our goals, but all too often involving others seems like more trouble than it&#x2019;s worth. <i>You Don&#x2019;t Have to Do It Alone</i> <i>Alone </i>is the Swiss Army Knife of involvement&#x2014;a set of tools that can be used in any setting to get you the help you need. The authors lay out a simple, straightforward plan for involving others to get things done, detailing a practical five-step involvement process that begins with five key questions:<br><br> What kind of involvement is needed?<br> How do I know who to include?<br> How do I invite people to become involved?<br> How do I keep people involved?<br> How do I finish the job?<br><br> The answers to these questions serve as a guide to finding the right people and keeping them energized, enthusiastic, and committed until the work is completed. Real life examples from corporations, government, and nonprofits illustrate the process in action.

When we are the ones who are asked to participate, we have another set of concerns. We want our voices to be heard and we want our ideas to be accepted. We want to experience the satisfaction that occurs when we pull together to make something happen.<br><br> Fears and Hopes Around Involvement<br><br> What do we worry about? We worry about the time it takes to involve others. We worry about the hassle that occurs when we have to incorporate other points of view. We worry about loss of control. And we worry about failure.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s take a look at these fears from two perspectives&#x2014;that of the involver and that of the person asked to be involved.<br><br> It will take too long. The involver fears: Involving others will delay getting things done, causing me to miss important deadlines. The involved person fears: If I get involved, it will take a lot of time away from my day-to-day work, leaving me with more work to do.<br><br> It&#x2019;s going to require more effort. The involver fears: It&#x2019;s going to take a lot of work to include others. I will have to bring them up to speed, figure out who needs to be involved, and then work through their differing opinions of what needs to be done. The involved person fears: If I get involved, I&#x2019;m going to have to convince my boss what needs to be done, and I&#x2019;m not sure he&#x2019;s interested. Besides, while I&#x2019;m doing that, my own work won&#x2019;t get done. It all seems to be more trouble than it&#x2019;s worth.<br><br> 2<br><br> I will lose control. The involver fears: Bringing people together means that I will not be able to predict the outcome. If I do it myself, I might not have the right answer, but at least it&#x2019;s an answer I can live with. It&#x2019;s just easier to do it myself. The involved person fears: If I become involved, it means I&#x2019;m going to have to consider others&#x2019; opinions. I don&#x2019;t want to make compromises when I know what needs to be done.<br><br> I will fail. The involver fears: When it&#x2019;s all said and done, I&#x2019;m the one who is responsible. If we fail, no one will blame them. It will all come back to me. I&#x2019;m not sure that others feel the same sense of ownership that I do. The involved person fears: If I get involved, I&#x2019;m going to have to live with what we decide. I&#x2019;m not sure that others care as much as I do. Will we suggest ideas that make things worse instead of better? Will we be worse off in the end?<br><br> If these fears ruled the day, involvement would never happen. But opposite these fears reside four hopes. What kind of hopes? The hope that by involving others time will be saved, the work will be made easier, new ideas will emerge, and we will create allies to support our work.<br><br> Now let&#x2019;s look at our hopes from both perspectives.<br><br> The work will get done faster. The involver hopes: If I involve others, there will be more people to do the work. I won&#x2019;t have to spend late nights and weekends organizing the garage sale or working on a presentation for my boss. If I involve others, they will be able to take over some of what I do. That will free up my time so that I can do the things that I&#x2019;m best at doing, where I can make a real contribution. The involved person hopes: By getting involved I hope that I will be helpful. I hope that by working with others I will help the job get done sooner. I hope that my contribution will make things go faster.<br><br> The job will be easier. The involver hopes: Instead of doing everything myself there will be others to call on to do the heavy lifting. Knowing that others are there to do the work will help me sleep at night. The involved person hopes: I hope that by joining this group the work will go more smoothly. I hope to pull my weight. I want to have fun. I hope that more hands will make light work.<br><br> Better ideas will develop. The involver hopes: If I give up some control, I hope I get better ideas in return. My fondest hope in involving others is that we will come up with new and better ways to do the job&#x2014;ideas that take a fresh look at old problems, ideas that provide solutions I couldn&#x2019;t see because I&#x2019;ve worked on the problem for too long. The involved person hopes: By getting involved I hope that I will make a contribution. I hope to help generate fresh ideas so that we come up with some new solutions to old problems.<br><br> 3<br><br> There will be other people to support me. The involver hopes: What I want most are allies, people to support my efforts, people to spread the word and encourage others to join. I want to know that there are others besides myself who are willing to work hard toward achieving the goal. When I&#x2019;m feeling discouraged, having allies gives me the courage to move on. The involved person hopes: I hope that by joining this group I will make new allies. I hope that instead of feeling that I have to do everything myself, there will be people to help me along the way.<br><br> Building a Foundation<br><br> Dealing successfully with hopes and fears requires a solid foundation.<br><br> The Japanese bullet train zooms over 200 miles an hour as it makes its way from Tokyo to Kyoto. But in the United States, similar trains barely reach speeds of 100 miles an hour. What&#x2019;s the difference? The foundation&#x2014;the tracks they sit on. American railroads are built on tracks that were designed for steam locomotives in the nineteenth century. Japanese lines feature high-tech tracks specifically built to accommodate the ultra-fast bullet train.<br><br> Fearing a horrendous accident, we would never think of running the bullet train in the United States at 200 miles an hour. But when the track bed is safe, we don&#x2019;t give these speeds a second thought.<br><br> By fully acknowledging our hopes and fears, we create a solid foundation for involving others. When we build our foundation with our fears in mind, we are aware of them, but we don&#x2019;t let our fears prevent us from moving forward. In the same way, while our hopes inspire us to action, we are not Pollyannaish about the task before us.<br><br> The Five Questions<br><br> This book is organized around a series of five questions that help us deal with our hopes and fears. When answered, these questions help us build a solid foundation for involving others. These five questions are asked by effective involvers whenever they tackle a new challenge. Answering these questions will allow you to build a safe track bed, one that allows you to move swiftly to your destination. The questions are:<br><br> What kind of involvement is needed?<br> How do I know whom to include?<br> How do I invite people to become involved?<br> How do I keep people involved?<br> How do I finish the job?<br> We devote a chapter to showing you how to answer each question whenever you take on new work. We also offer a chapter called &#x201c;Meetings: The Involvement Edge&#x201d; that provides a blueprint for designing high-involvement meetings. A concluding chapter, &#x201c;Where to Start,&#x201d; provides options for where to begin. There are also a reference set of checklists and some ideas for further learning.<br><br> What kind of challenges do effective involvers tackle? It could mean solving a problem at work that has been bugging you for months. It could mean saving your company millions of dollars. It could mean launching a community movement to improve your schools or the local health care system. It might even mean drawing on the ideas and energies of thousands of citizens to decide the future of the World Trade Center site in New York City.<br><br> Our approach has been tested for the past ten years in organizations such as Boeing, Marriott, and the Cabinet Office of the British Government. These are no-nonsense organizations where time is of the essence, resources like money and talent are precious, and the pressures to perform are enormous. They are also subject to intense scrutiny by many stakeholders, from corporate shareholders and employees to civic groups and ordinary citizens. The plans such organizations develop and the means they use to carry them out must be effective; if they are not, the repercussions may be enormous. These organizations have learned that effective involvement is the key to making smart decisions and making them work better. We predict that you will discover this, too.<br><br> How do we know these are the right questions? Effective involvers told us so. We asked some of the most productive, creative, and resourceful people we know to walk us through their own techniques for organizing and managing their work. The structure of the book grew out of what they told us. These same effective involvers also read the chapters as they were written and helped us shape the contents to be as useful and practical as possible.<br><br> Taken together, the steps in You Don&#x2019;t Have to Do It Alone provide you with the tools for creating organizational energy&#x2014;the kind of energy that can only come when we involve others to get things done. We begin to involve others when we ask ourselves the first question, &#x201c;What kind of involvement is needed?&#x201d; Your journey toward successful involvement begins on the next page.</p><h2>The State Nobility: Elite Schools in the Field of Power</h2><p>In this major new work, Pierre Bourdieu examines the distinctive forms of power&#x2015;political, intellectual, bureaucratic, and economic&#x2015;by means of which contemporary societies are governed. What kinds of competence are claimed by the bureaucrats and technocrats who govern us? And how do those who govern gain our recognition and acquiescence? Bourdieu examines in detail the work of consecration that is carried out by elite education systems&#x2015;in France by the <i>grande �coles</i>, in the United States by the Ivy League schools, and in England by Oxford and Cambridge. Today, this "state nobility" has at its disposal an unprecedented range of powers and distinctive titles to justify its privilege. Bourdieu shows how it is the heir&#x2015;structural and sometimes genealogical&#x2015;of the <i>noblesse de robe</i>, which, in order to consolidate its position in relation to other forms of power, had to construct the modern state and the republican myths, meritocracy, and civil service that went along with it. Combining ethnographic description, historical documentation, statistical analysis, and theoretical argument, Bourdieu develops a wide-ranging and highly original account of the forms of power and governance that have come to prevail in our society today.</p><p>&#x201c;Since the 1960s, Pierre Bourdieu&#x2019;s terrific constancy has been there to hold us to the vision and division of criticism, detachment, reason, truth. . . . The State Nobility is an enormous addition to his vast architecture.&#x201d;&#x2014;Times Higher Education SupplementPierre Bourdieu is Professor of Sociology at the Coll�ge de France. Stanford University Press has published nine other books by Bourdieu, most recently The Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field <i>(1996).</i></p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Moliere (Cambridge Companions to Literature)</h2><p>A detailed introduction to Moli�re and his plays, this Companion evokes his own theatrical career, his theatres, patrons, the performers and theatre staff with whom he worked, and the various publics he and his troupes entertained with such success. It looks at his particular brands of comedy and satire. L'�cole des femmes, Le Tartuffe, Dom Juan, Le Misanthrope, L'Avare and Les Femmes savantes are examined from a variety of different viewpoints, and through the eyes of different ages and cultures. The comedies-ballets, a genre invented by Moli�re and his collaborators, are re-instated to the central position which they held in his &#x153;uvre in Moli�re's own lifetime; his two masterpieces in this genre, Le Bourgeois gentilhomme and Le Malade imaginaire, have chapters to themselves. Finally, the Companion looks at modern directors' theatre, exploring the central role played by productions of his work in successive 'revolutions' in the dramatic arts in France.</p><p>A broad and detailed introduction to Moli�re and his plays, this Companion examines Moli�re&#39;s life and career, his theatres, comedy and satire in his plays, and his innovative com�dies-ballets.David Bradby is Professor of Drama and Theatre Studies at Royal Holloway, University of London.</p><h2>Between North and South: The Letters of Emily Wharton Sinkler, 1842-1865</h2><p>Emily Wharton Sinkler was 18 years old when she began to write to distant relatives, chronicling her experiences on an antebellum cotton plantation.

Though repelled by her principles, Basil is enchanted by the lovely Verena and becomes determined to convert her to his rigidly conservative views of a woman&#x2019;s place. He argues that Verena is made for private passion not a public career, and wants to marry her and take her away from those he feels are exploiting her. But Olive, a serious devotee of the cause, has made Verena her prot�g�e and taken her into her home. What ensues is a battle for the young woman&#x2019;s body and soul by two antagonists with wills stronger than hers. Riveting in its narrative drama, rich and sympathetic in its ironies, <i>The Bostonians </i>is the work of a master psychologist at the top of his form.<br>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed)</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

MUF is a collaborative art and architecture practice committed to working in public space. An all-women practice with a string of innovative urban projects and the glorygrowing as the Dome disappears under the weight of failure and recriminationof having been sacked from London's Millennium Dome, MUF has attained a certain notoriety, largely through media interest often focused on gender rather than architecture. More than a conventional monograph, <i>This Is What We Do</i> describes and illustrates in detail the processes developed by MUF to enable effective consultationvery different from the 'community architecture' of the 1980s. The book, with photographs and illustration throughout, is broadly based around four factors that characterize MUF's workconsultation, collaboration, identity and mechanisms. It includes an essay by Katherine Shonfield examining MUF's work in the context of public space and town planning, while Adrian Dannatt traces the evolution of the office. Projects covered include Car-free London, the hypocaust building in St. Albans, 'Purity and Tolerance' installation in the Economist building, the Millennium Dome's 'local zone', Sure Start, the Pleasure Garden of the Utilities in Stoke on Trent and the Museum of Women's Art.

Using its signature conversational prose, the textbook guides students through the lives and works of history&#39;s greatest philosophers, drawing from both canonical primary sources and the latest philosophical critiques.</p><p>Douglas Soccio was professor of philosophy at Shasta College for nearly 30 years. In addition to ARCHETYPES OF WISDOM: AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY, 9E, he is the author of HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF PHILOSOPHY, and, with Vincent E. Barry, PRACTICAL LOGIC, all of which are published by Cengage Learning. For three years he wrote a weekly philosophy column for the REDDING RECORD SEARCHLIGHT. Now devoted to writing on a full-time basis, he is presently developing a collection of philosophical stories that express what he describes as &#34;philosophy with a heart,&#34; a generous notion of philosophy that infuses all of his writing."[Soccio's text is] [e]asy to understand, applicable to twenty-first century, unbiased."<br><br>"The greatest strength of Soccio is that it covers a great deal of material and includes most of the salient ideas. It also conveys the "trajectory" of the Western philosophical history and emphasizes how the philosophers were influenced by history and have influenced history. It's also accessible to students."<br><br>"Soccio's pedagogy and methodology are masterful. I have used this text in several incarnations starting with the second edition. I keep coming back to it because it makes my job easier. He works hard to make things clear to beginners without obvious "dumbing down." College students notice when they are being condescended to, and it destroys their motivation."</p><h2>A New Deal for the World: America&#x2019;s Vision for Human Rights</h2><p><p>In a work of sweeping scope and luminous detail, Elizabeth Borgwardt describes how a cadre of World War II American planners inaugurated the ideas and institutions that underlie our modern international human rights regime. </p><p>Borgwardt finds the key in the 1941 Atlantic Charter and its Anglo-American vision of "war and peace aims." In attempting to globalize what U.S. planners heralded as domestic New Deal ideas about security, the ideology of the Atlantic Charter--buttressed by FDR's "Four Freedoms" and the legacies of World War I--redefined human rights and America's vision for the world.</p><p>Three sets of international negotiations brought the Atlantic Charter blueprint to life--Bretton Woods, the United Nations, and the Nuremberg trials. These new institutions set up mechanisms to stabilize the international economy, promote collective security, and implement new thinking about international justice. The design of these institutions served as a concrete articulation of U.S. national interests, even as they emphasized the importance of working with allies to achieve common goals. The American architects of these charters were attempting to redefine the idea of security in the international sphere. To varying degrees, these institutions and the debates surrounding them set the foundations for the world we know today.</p><p>By analyzing the interaction of ideas, individuals, and institutions that transformed American foreign policy--and Americans' view of themselves--Borgwardt illuminates the broader history of modern human rights, trade and the global economy, collective security, and international law. This book captures a lost vision of the American role in the world.</p></p><p>Elizabeth (Kopelman) Borgwardt is Associate Professor of History at Washington University in St. Louis.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/BORNEW_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Lucian Freud</h2><p>Lucian Freud&#39;s massive nudes are among the most powerful and moving visual images of our time, and in this exhaustive overview of Freud&#39;s career, readers can trace how he arrived at them. Photos of Freud at work provide a unique view of this very private man. 340 illustrations, many in color.</p><p>Lucian Freud has always stirred controversy with his radical reinvention of artistic conventions. In particular his graphic male nudes, both portraits of himself and of others, have embodied a rejection of youth&#39;s sleek smooth lines in favor of age&#39;s unglamorous and unvarnished naturalism. His recent studies of obese male and female models have renewed his reputation as controversialist. This book reminds us that some of his work over the years has been at times more accepted. His portrait of artist Francis Bacon set new standards for truth in portraiture. He painted his mother with huge affection. His landscapes of London have been taken as social commentary, reflections of the metaphorical and literal decay he sees around him. This book records the artist&#39;s career after 50 years as a painter.Bruce Bernard, the author of the introduction, knew Freud from 1943 and his knowledge of the artist and his work was unparalleled.</p><h2>Value-Free Science?: Ideals and Illusion</h2><p>It has long been thought that science is our best hope for realizing objective knowledge, but that, to deliver on this promise, it must be value free. Things are not so simple, however, as recent work in science studies makes clear. The contributors to this volume investigate where and how values are involved in science, and examine the implications of this involvement for ideals of objectivity.<br></p><p><br><strong>Harold Kincaid</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alabama.<br><br><strong>John Dupr� </strong>is Professor of Philosophy of Science and Director of the ESRC Centre for Genomics in Society at the University of Exeter.<br><br>"Historians of science whose work has led them to puzzle over their own and their historical actors' judgments of the relations between value and scientific fact will find much of value here."--Alan Richardson, <em>Isis</em><p></p><br>"A valuable anthology of essays by contemporary philosophers."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"A well structured and informative introduction provides readers with background on the question of values in science....

Many people assume that success in life involves &#34;trying harder&#34;. Nothing is further from the truth. The most successful people are those who &#34;find a horse to ride&#34;: the one idea, the one company, the one thing, or even the one person that can propel them to the top. How to go about finding the &#34;horse&#34; is the subject of this book.</p><p></p><h2>Letters from America</h2><p><p><b>A remarkable collection of charming and eloquent letters that contain the seeds of Tocqueville&#x2019;s later masterful account of American democracy</b><br><br> Young Alexis de Tocqueville arrived in the United States for the first time in May 1831, commissioned by the French government to study the American prison system. For the next nine months he and his companion, Gustave de Beaumont, traveled and observed not only prisons but also the political, economic, and social systems of the early republic. Along the way, they frequently reported back to friends and family members in France. This book presents the first translation of the complete letters Tocqueville wrote during that seminal journey, accompanied by excerpts from Beaumont&#x2019;s correspondence that provide details or different perspectives on the places, people, and American life and attitudes the travelers encountered.</p><p>These delightful letters provide an intimate portrait of the complicated, talented Tocqueville, who opened himself without prejudice to the world of Jacksonian America. Moreover, they contain many of the impressions and ideas that served as preliminary sketches for <i>Democracy in America</i>, his classic account of the American democratic system that remains an important reference work to this day. Accessible, witty, and charming, the letters Tocqueville penned while in America are of major interest to general readers, scholars, and students alike.</p></p><p><p><b>Frederick Brown</b> is professor emeritus, State University of New York at Stony Brook.

This vantage point allows a bracing and thoroughly original rethink of the power of baroque relics and reliquaries. It shows how a focus on miracles produces original interpretations of architecture, sanctity and place which will engage architectural historians everywhere. The matter of the baroque miracle extends into a rigorous engagement with natural history, telluric philosophy, new materialism, theory and philosophy. The study will transform our understanding of baroque art and architecture, sanctity and Naples. Bristling with new archival materials and historical insights, this study lifts the baroque from its previous marginalisation to engage fiercely with materiality and potentiality and thus unleash baroque art and architecture as productive and transformational.</p><p>Helen Hills is Professor of History of Art at the University of York</p><h2>Everyday Mathematics: Games, Teacher&#39;s Guide, Grades K-6</h2><p>This is a manual which shows how to play games using the Everyday Mathematics program.</p><p></p><h2>The Oxford Companion to Scottish History</h2><p><em>The Oxford Companion to Scottish History</em> has more than 170 expert contributors.

His best-known book, After Virtue (1981), spurred the profound revival of virtue ethics. Moreover, MacIntyre, unlike so many of his contemporaries, has exerted a deep influence beyond the bounds of academic philosophy. This volume focuses on the major themes of MacIntyre&#39;s work with critical expositions of MacIntyre&#39;s views on the history of philosophy, the role of tradition in philosophical inquiry, the philosophy of the social sciences, moral philosophy, political theory, and his critique of the assumptions and institutions of modernity. Written by a distinguished roster of philosophers, this volume will have a wide appeal outside philosophy to students in the social sciences, law, theology, and political theory. Mark C. Murphy is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown University. He is author of Natural Law and Practical Rationality (Cambridge, 2001) and An Essay on Divine Authority (Cornell, 2002), as well as of a number of articles on natural law theory, political obligation, and Hobbes&#39; moral, political, and legal philosophy.

Each infinitely useful volume presents one of the world&#x2019;s foremost architects and features 10 of his or her finest residential works-including presentation, drawings, sketches, and working drawings. These full-color, highly affordable volumes will enhance any library, providing an essential reference for architecture students and individuals looking for home design ideas. <p>For Ace Architects, house design begins with the idiosyncrasies of their clients, including personal interests, program, site, context, and budget. They are especially interested in those occasions, often somewhat eccentric ones, which lead to the design of places intimately suited to their inhabitants and unlike all other places. They feel the best houses provoke a nearly palpable sensation of their inhabitants, even when unoccupied. Such a philosophy is illustrated in this monograph that includes ten of Ace Architects&#x2019; energetic, colorful, and spatially charged residences.

Though the last two centuries have seen an inversion in the portion of people living on farms to those in cities, the land still beckons, whether traversed in a car or train, scanned from far above, or as the locus of our food supply or leisure. </p><p><i>The Rural Landscape</i> provides a deceptively simple method for approaching the often complex and variegated shape of the land. Hart divides it into its mineral, vegetable, and animal components and shows how each are interdependent, using examples from across Europe and America. Looking at the land forms of southern England, for instance, he comments on the use of hedgerows to divide fields, the mineral or geomorphological features of the land determining where hedgerows will grow in service of the human animal's needs. Hart reveals the impact on the land of human culture and the basic imperative of making a living as well as the evolution of technical skills toward that end (as seen in the advance of barbed wire as a function of modern transportation).</p><p>Hart describes with equal clarity the erosion of land to form river basins and the workings of a coal mine. He charts shifting patterns of crop rotation, from the medieval rota of food (wheat or rye), feed (barley or oats), and fallow (to restore the land) to modern two-crop cycle of corn and soybeans, made possible by fertilizers and pesticides. He comments on traditions of land division (it is almost impossible to find a straight line on a map of Europe) and inventories a variety of farm structures (from hop yards and oast houses to the use of dikes for irrigation). He identifies the relict features of the landscape&#x2015;from low earthen terraces once used in the southern United States to prevent erosion to old bank buildings that have become taverns and barns turned into human homes. Carrying the story of the rural landscape into our frantic era, he describes the "bow wave"where city life meets rural agriculture and plots the effect of recreation and its structures on the look of the land. </p></p><p><p>From the acclaimed landscape historian and geographer, a comprehensive handbook to understanding the elements that make up the rural landscape.</p><p><b>John Fraser Hart </b> is professor of geography at the University of Minnesota.

They have significantly worse social benefits compared to other Western nations, and studies show that the American Dream of upward mobility is, for them, largely a myth. So why do these people love their country? Why have they not risen up to demand more from a system that is failing them?<br><br>In <i>Broke and Patriotic</i>, Francesco Duina contends that the best way to answer these questions is to speak directly to America's most impoverished. Spending time in bus stations, laundromats, senior citizen centers, homeless shelters, public libraries, and fast food restaurants, Duina conducted over 60 revealing interviews in which the people he met explain how they view themselves and their country. He masterfully weaves their words into three narratives. First, America's poor still see their country as the "last hope" for themselves and the world: America offers its people a sense of dignity, closeness to God, and answers to most of humanity's problems. Second, America is still the "land of milk and honey": a very rich and generous country where those who work hard can succeed. Third, America is the freest country on earth where self-determination is still possible. This book offers a stirring portrait of the people left behind by their country and left out of the national conversation. By giving them a voice, Duina sheds new light on a sector of American society that we are only beginning to recognize as a powerful force in shaping the country's future.</p><p><b>Francesco Duina</b> is Professor of Sociology at Bates College, as well as Honorary Professor of Sociology at the University of British Columbia and Visiting Professor of Business and Politics at the Copenhagen Business School.

Social understandings can be furthered more by this book than by any other at present in the marketplace."<br>--John A. Hall, McGill University<br><br>"A superb book! Anyone who wants to know why poor Americans love their country should read this. The answers Duina finds to this question are startling and reveal deep and enduring beliefs in freedom, God, and the American Dream. The lessons Duina provides are especially important given the current state of American politics."<br>--John L. Campbell, Dartmouth College and Copenhagen Business School<br><br>"An excellent, timely book, which can help us understand the results of the recent elections. The American poor do not envy the rich. They are proud to be Americans and derive personal dignity from membership in the nation. Rather than blame their poverty on society, they take responsibility for it.

He draws extensively on previously unused and little-known archival resources, including the shocking transcriptions of the &#x201c;Axis Broadcasts in Arabic&#x201d; radio programs, which convey a strongly anti-Semitic message.</p><p>Herf explores the intellectual, political, and cultural context in which German and European radical anti-Semitism was found to resonate with similar views rooted in a selective appropriation of the traditions of Islam. Pro-Nazi Arab exiles in wartime Berlin, including Haj el-Husseini and Rashid el-Kilani, collaborated with the Nazis in constructing their Middle East propaganda campaign. By integrating the political and military history of the war in the Middle East with the intellectual and cultural dimensions of the propagandistic diffusion of Nazi ideology, Herf offers the most thorough examination to date of this important chapter in the history of World War II. Importantly, he also shows how the anti-Semitism promoted by the Nazi propaganda effort contributed to the anti-Semitism exhibited by adherents of radical forms of Islam in the Middle East today.</p></p><p><b>Jeffrey Herf</b> is a Professor in the Department of History at the University of Maryland in College Park.&#x201c;Jeffrey Herf provides a vivid history of Nazi propaganda in the Middle East by using an array of newly discovered sources.

He shows how Nazi propaganda harnessed European and indigenous anti-Semitism to form a lethal form of racism.&nbsp;The result continues to poison the Middle East's intellectual life today and has helped fuel a virulent opposition to modernity that haunts us today."&#x2014;Ian Johnson, author of <i>A Mosque in Munich</i> (Ian Johnson)<br><br>"Herf is a prominent scholar in and is a member of a tiny community of experts who are both familiar with Nazi Germany and the Arab world; so no one like Herf is in a position to complete such a well-founded study on the spread of Nazi propaganda in the Middle East. Herf shows how Nazis employed media in Arabic &#x2013; such as short-wave radio &#x2013; to win the Middle East. The dreadful impact of this propaganda has been the pan-Arab nationalist adoption of Nazi ideology. On the top of this impact is the pan-Arab adoption of Nazi anti-Semitism. Therefore, Herf&#x2019;s book focuses on this issue, analyzing original materials and providing new insights. In the past decades secular pan-Arabism has been replaced by Islamism, but the German Nazi traces of anti-Semitism disclosed in the groundbreaking analysis continues to be in place, despite the Islamization of this ideology.

William S. Triplet was a seventeen-year-old junior in high school when, on April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson asked for a declaration of war. Passed by Congress and signed by the nation's chief executive four days later, this declaration stirred the superintendent of schools in Triplet's hometown of Sedalia, Missouri, to make an emotional plea to all eligible students to join the armed forces. "Any student who felt called upon to fight, bleed, and die for his country could receive his graduation diploma upon his return from the war." Triplet was eighteen months short of being of legal enlistment age, but the army didn't check birth certificates. The appeal of military benefits&#x2014;room and board, travel, adventure, and fifteen dollars a month, plus knowing he would receive his high school diploma&#x2014;was too much for the young Triplet to pass up. Thus began William S. Triplet's remarkable career in the U.S. Army, in which he served until his retirement as a full colonel in 1954.</p><p>In <i>A Youth in the Meuse-Argonne,</i> Triplet covers the early years of his service in Company D, 140th Infantry Regiment, 35th Division, from shortly after the time of his enlistment in 1917 to his honorable discharge in 1919. During those months he participated in several actions, most notably the battle of the Meuse-Argonne. With both elegance and a touch of humor, he masterfully portrays the everyday life of the soldier, humanizing the men with whom he served. His vivid depictions of how soldiers fought give the reader a much clearer view of the terrifying experiences of combat. He also touches on the special problems he encountered as a sergeant with an infantry platoon composed of soldiers from many different walks of life.</p><p>In writing this memoir, Triplet relied heavily on a detailed diary that he kept while he was in France in 1918. Through his annotations, Robert H. Ferrell provides the historical context for Triplet's firsthand experiences. The result is a compelling memoir that offers insight into the lives of the soldiers who served during World War I. Anyone with an interest in World War I or military history in general will find <i>A Youth in the Meuse-Argonne</i> of great interest.</p></p><p><p>Robert H. Ferrell (1921-2018) is the author or editor of numerous books, including<i> Presidential Leadership: From Woodrow Wilson to Harry S. Truman,</i><i>Harry S. Truman: A Life,</i> and<i> Five Days in October: The Lost Battalion of World War I, </i>available from the University of Missouri Press.</p>At the age of 17, the author of this memoir left high school in a Missouri town to enlist in the National Guard for the Great War and found himself a sergeant of infantry in the 35th (Missouri-Kansas) Division during the closing months of hostilities in France. The 35th Division, also home to Harry Truman's artillery battery, was mauled in General Pershing's Meuse-Argonne offensive, the largest and most costly single battle in American military history (one million American troops engaged and 26,000 killed). With consistent humor and fine detail, Triplet recounts his experiences and characterizes his associatesAfrom enlistment and training through service in several actions and the armistice. After the war, Triplet went on to West Point and served 30 years as a career regular army officer. The text of his memoir, which he apparently drafted using his extensive diaries and which continues past the period covered in this volume, was discovered two years ago at U.S. Military History Institute (after Triplet's death in 1994) by Ferrell, professor emeritus of history at Indiana University (Harry S. Truman; The Dying President: Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1944-1945; etc.). While not extraordinarily wrenching, it makes informative, absorbing and remarkably effortless reading, a ready window onto a different era and a singular wartime experienceAone to be continued as further installments of the text appear in the coming months.

In the first book in English to focus on Angelopoulos's unique cinematic vision, Andrew Horton provides an illuminating contextual study that attempts to demonstrate the quintessentially Greek nature of the director's work. Horton situates the director in the context of over 3,000 years of Greek culture and history. Somewhat like Andrei Tarkovsky in Russia or Antonioni in Italy, Angelopoulos has used cinema to explore the history and individual identities of his culture. With such far-reaching influences as Greek myth, ancient tragedy and epic, Byzantine iconography and ceremony, Greek and Balkan history, modern Greek pop culture including bouzouki music, shadow puppet theater, and the Greek music hall tradition, Angelopoulos emerges as an original "thinker" with the camera, and a distinctive director who is bound to make a lasting contribution to the art form.</p><br><p> In a series of films including <i>The Travelling Players</i>, <i>Voyage to Cythera</i>, <i>Landscape in the Mist</i>, <i>The Suspended Step of the Stork</i>, and most recently in <i>Ulysses' Gaze</i> starring Harvey Keitel (winner of the 1995 Cannes Film Festival Grand Prix), Angelopoulos has developed a remarkable cinematic style, characterized by carefully composed scenes and an enormous number of extended long shots. In an age of ever decreasing attention spans, Angelopoulos offers a cinema of contemplation.</p></p><p><p>"Theo Angelopoulos is a masterful filmmaker. He really understands how to control the frame. There are sequences in his work--the wedding scene in<i>The Suspended Step of the Stork</i>; the rape scene in <i>Landscape in the Mist</i>; or any given scene in<i>The Traveling Players</i>--where the slightest movement, the slightest change in distance, sends reverberations through the film and through the viewer. The total effect is hypnotic, sweeping, and profoundly emotional. His sense of control is almost otherworldly."<b>--Martin Scorsese</b></p><p>"Horton's book fills a crucial gap in film studies by bringing to attention the work of a European filmmaker whose films remain unfamiliar to many. This book is an extraordinary study of a major artist and one that should help make Angelopoulos a much better known figure in this country."<b>--Stuart McDougal, University of Michigan</b></p><p>"The interpretive conception, the argument, and the conclusion of this book are nothing short of brilliant. It is as if Angelopoulos comes into his own with Andrew Horton's writing.

Manhein&#x2015;or &#x201c;the bone lady,&#x201d; as law enforcement personnel call her. In this, one of dozens of stories recollected in her powerful memoir, Manhein and the state police eventually unearth a black plastic bag buried in the banks of the Mississippi River containing the body of a man who has been missing for five years. After the painstaking process of examining the remains, confirming the victim&#x2019;s identity, and preparing a formal report for the police, Manhein testifies for the prosecution at the murder trial. The defendant is convicted (in no small part because of Manhein), and &#x201c;the bone lady&#x201d; has helped solve yet another mystery.</p><p>As director of the Forensic Anthropology and Computer Enhancement Services (FACES) Laboratory at Louisiana State University, Manhein unravels mysteries of life and death every day.

In turn, populations of anatomically modern humans, Homo sapiens, came to dominate the area. Seeking to understand the nature of this replacement, which has become a hotly debated issue, Paul Mellars brings together an unprecedented amount of information on the behavior of Neanderthals. His comprehensive overview ranges from the evidence of tool manufacture and related patterns of lithic technology, through the issues of subsistence and settlement patterns, to the more controversial evidence for social organization, cognition, and intelligence. Mellars argues that previous attempts to characterize Neanderthal behavior as either "modern" or "ape-like" are both overstatements. We can better comprehend the replacement of Neanderthals, he maintains, by concentrating on the social and demographic structure of Neanderthal populations and on their specific adaptations to the harsh ecological conditions of the last glaciation.</p><br><p> Mellars's approach to these issues is grounded firmly in his archaeological evidence. He illustrates the implications of these findings by drawing from the methods of comparative socioecology, primate studies, and Pleistocene paleoecology. The book provides a detailed review of the climatic and environmental background to Neanderthal occupation in Europe, and of the currently topical issues of the behavioral and biological transition from Neanderthal to fully "modern" populations.</p></p><p><b>Paul Mellars</b> is both Reader in Prehistory and President of Corpus Christi College of the University of Cambridge.

Now, eminent philosopher Simon Blackburn offers the most authoritative and up-to-date dictionary of philosophy available in a single volume, packed with helpful information for the novice and with astute observations for the expert. Ranging from Aristotle to Zen, the two thousand plus entries cover the entire span of philosophy, from the Vedas (written over three thousand years ago) to the most recent technical terminology, with ample coverage of important themes from Chinese, Indian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophy.<br> Here are all the terms one would expect to find in a comprehensive dictionary of philosophy--idealism and empiricism, ethics and aesthetics, Epicureanism and Stoicism, deism and pantheism, liberalism and conservatism, existentialism and logical positivism, and much more. Blackburn also defines many terms and concepts not normally found in such reference works, including entries for apathy, Elis (the Greek city which passed a law exempting all philosophers from taxation), laughter, and the meaning of life, and he includes relevant terms from disciplines such as mathematics, physics, biology, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. In addition, there are capsule biographies of nearly five hundred individuals, from the pre-Socratics, to such major figures as Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hobbes, Hegel, Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, to such contemporary figures as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Richard Rorty, Simone de Beauvoir, and Luce Irigaray. Many more women appear here than in other philosophical dictionaries, ranging from Lady Anne Finch Conway, a 17th-century Quaker philosopher and an influence on Leibniz, to Hypatia, an important 4th-century Neoplatonist and mathematician of Alexandria, who was tortured and murdered by Christian Monks at the behest of the patriarch Cyril. And Blackburn also includes figures such as Einstein, Darwin, and Aesop. Finally, Blackburn interjects much of his own personality and wit into these entries. For instance, writing on Francis Bacon, he observes that Bacon's "legal philosophy was one of absolute duty to the sovereign, which cannot have hindered his rise to the position of Lord Chancellor." And he begins his entry on apathy with "Although it is the particular enemy of teachers and sports coaches, apathy often gets a good philosophical press, especially in ethical systems that regard desire and worldly interest as low and unworthy."<br> A survey of philosophy through the eyes of one of its leading practitioners, <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</em> is both a handy reference and an intriguing book in which to browse. It is an essential volume for anyone interested in philosophy.</p><p><br><strong>Simon Blackburn</strong> is Edna J. Koury Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina. He was a fellow and tutor at Pembroke College, Oxford University, from 1969 to 1990. He is the author of <em>Spreading the Word</em> and <em>Essays in Quasi-Realism</em>, and from 1984 to 1990, he was editor of the journal <em>Mind</em>.<br>In his preface to the first edition, reprinted here, the author states that his "own interests and assessments are not always disguised." This is true of the second edition as well, providing such delicious morsels as, in the entry on Jacques Derrida, "Derrida's work . . . is not easily assimilated by people used to normal expressions of thought." Nevertheless, the vast majority of entries are admirably objective. Blackburn's preference is for--and expertise lies in--the branch of the Western philosophical tradition culminating in academic Anglo-American philosophy. <p>Although the book jacket claims this to be a "vastly expanded second edition, with over 500 new entries," there is no indication in the new preface or elsewhere what these new entries are. The page count has not altered significantly from the first edition. More than 500 of the new edition's more than 3,000 entries are biographical, including non-Western thinkers such as Confucius and Kitaro Nishida and nonphilosophers such as Dante and Freud. Among the terms covered are <i>Apathy, Capitalism, Environmental ethics, Hedonism, Hatha-yoga, Taoism, Ontology, Self-deception, Turing machine, Vedanta, Whig view of history,</i> and <i>Welfare.</i> Entries range in length from a sentence (e.g., <i>Formal implication, Free variable</i>) to nearly two pages (e.g., <i>Kant, Immanuel</i>). There is extensive cross-referencing within and between the lucid entries. Concluding the volume are an appendix of logical symbols and a chronology of important philosophical and other cultural dates.</p><p>The second edition's jacket quotes the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> on the first edition: "the most comprehensive dictionary of philosophy in English." This is no longer true and was perhaps untrue even in 1996. In the last 10 years, a variety of excellent -single-author and multiple-author one-volume philosophical dictionaries, encyclopedias, and "companions" have become available (not to mention far more extensive print and Internet references). Each offers entries and viewpoints not found in any of the others so it makes good sense to have more than one. <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</i> is an excellent choice for public and academic libraries. <i>Craig Bunch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It covers all the Big Questions that turn people on to philosophy, with a selection of classic and contemporary readings that are clear and accessible while also being challenging and provocative."--Susan Wolf, <em>University of North</em> <em>Carolina</em><p></p><br>"This book is a real gem. It combines the <em>de rigueur</em> historical texts with the cream of the contemporary articles that continue work on all the classic problems of philosophy. It is the best available text for Intro. courses. As a bonus, the authors have included a section on puzzles and paradoxes, and there is also a glossary of technical terms. My next Intro. course text will be Perry-Bratman-Fischer."--Anthony Brueckner, <em>University of California, Santa Barbara</em><p></p><br>"A comprehensive collection of classic and modern contributions to the enduring problems of philosophy. The essays are well chosen and edited; an introductory text without peer."--Jules Coleman, <em>Yale Law School</em><p></p><br>"The editors are a trio of superb philosophers with over 100 years of teaching experience among them. Their experience shines through in the selection of readings, the introductions (to the volume and to the six main parts of the book), and the study questions. This is the best anthology I have ever seen for an introductory philosophy course."--Alfred R. Mele, <em>Florida State University</em><p></p><br>"This collection does a marvelous job of introducing students to philosophy. It contains an excellent selection of texts--a menu rich in options for constructing a wide range of courses. Each section begins with a very helpful summary of the main issues at stake in that section. These summaries are guides, not only to the texts themselves, but also to how to think about problems philosophically. It would be hard for a student to read them without being sucked into the philosophical debates. The paradoxes and puzzles at the end of the book are a terrific addition. And I have never seen a better glossary: for each entry there is, not a definition, but a concise discussion of the issues associated with the term. . . . [A] truly exemplary introduction to philosophy."--Sarah Buss, <em>University of Michigan</em><p></p><br>"The best introduction to philosophy anthology available. . . . The previous edition was the single best anthology on the market; I have been using it happily for over a decade, and believe that with the new readings it is even better. I think the book is excellent and will be using it as soon as I can."--Thomas Ryckman, <em>Lawrence University</em><p></p><br>"The strength of the book is its comprehensiveness. If you're only going to use one book in an introductory course, it should be this one."--Brian Weatherson, <em>Cornell University</em><p></p><br>"These are the best chapter introductions I have seen in any introductory collection. The writing is pitched at just the right level of complexity, but more importantly, the ideas are high quality. . . . The book manages to be interesting and genuinely illuminating (even to me), but remains understandable to the first-year student."--Thomas Bittner, <em>University of British Columbia</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Cheri and The Last of Cheri</h2><p><br><br><p><i>Ch�ri</i> is one of the most honest, sensual, and poignant breakup stories ever written. First published in 1920, it was instantly greeted by Marcel Proust and Andr� Gide as a masterpiece and today remains Colette&#x2019;s most admired work. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>L�a de Lonval is an aging courtesan, a once famous beauty facing the end of her sexual career. She is also facing the end of her most intense love affair, with Fred Peloux&#x2014;known as Ch�ri&#x2014;a playboy half her age. But neither lover under-stands how deeply they are attached, or how much life they will give up by parting ways. A classic portrait of French manners before World War I, <i>Ch�ri </i>also captures a lasting truth about the connections between sex, love, and feelings of mortality.

Based upon a previously unpublished series of dreams of one of Jung&#39;s patients.</p><p></p><h2>Marco Polo and the Discovery of the World</h2><p>After many years in Asia, Marco Polo wrote one of the most influential books of the past millennium. No mere travel account, Polo&#x2019;s<i> Book</i> is a work that played a key role in the development of European overseas expansion. In this engaging and authoritative book, historian John Larner explores for the first time the full range of influence of Polo&#x2019;s <i>Book</i> on the history of geography and exploration. Larner assesses the findings of modern scholarship and offers an original account of Polo and his family, of how and why the <i>Book</i> came into being, and of its reception over the centuries.<br><br>Beginning with a discussion of the extent of European knowledge of Asia early in the thirteenth century, Larner considers what is known about Marco Polo&#x2019;s life and the composition of his text. He examines the <i>Book</i>&#x2019;s scope and sources (vindicating its author from recent claims that he never visited China), as well as the nature of Polo&#x2019;s cooperation with his co-author Rustichello da Pisa. He traces the manuscript forms and translations of Polo&#x2019;s <i>Book</i> in the Middle Ages, its influence on Western cartographers, its fortunes in the climate of fifteenth-century humanism, the possible extent of its encouragement to Columbus, and its later evolution into such new guises as the object of historical scholarship and exotic curiosity. Finally, Larner provides a fresh view of the enigmatic Polo, who, despite a deliberate cultivation of impersonality, continues today to engage the attention of readers.<br></p><p>Marco Polo is important not because he traveled extensively in Asia--other 13th-century Europeans did that--but because he wrote down his experiences for others to read. In this excellent study, John Larner of Glasgow University assesses the impact of Polo's <i>Travels</i> on the intellectual society of his day. The book's contribution to learning was immense, giving medieval Europeans new information that forever changed their understanding of Europe's place in the world. Larner analyzes different versions of the book, originally written in a Genoa prison and translated into many languages within Polo's lifetime. He illustrates a number of fascinating early maps and analyzes Polo's influence on later geographical and literary treatises. Though Polo says very little about himself, Larner finds clues to his personality. Polo left Venice when he was 17 and remained in Asia until he was 41; Europe must have seemed strange to him, even uncouth, after his decades of service to Kublai Khan, Mongol emperor of China, the richest and most sophisticated country in the world at the time. Polo formed a strong affinity with the Mongolians, which may explain his failure to learn the Chinese language or mention Chinese customs such as tea-drinking or foot binding, occasionally suggested as evidence that he never in fact visited China. <i>Marco Polo and the Discovery of the World</i> demonstrates in straightforward language and with satisfying detective work how the record of a man's travels became one the most influential books of the millennium. <i>--John Stevenson</i>&#34;Larner has written an erudite, comprehensive, and very readable study of the enigmatic Venetian Marco Polo, his book, and the book&#39;s impact on European culture.&#34; Choice John Larner is Professor Emeritus in History and Professorial Fellow of Glasgow University.</p><h2>Tale of Two Cities (Great Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>In the early days of the French Revolution, a young Englishman determines to do the utmost to save the husband of the woman he loves from the guillotine.</p><p></p><h2>Learning and Teaching Early Math: The Learning Trajectories Approach (Studies in Mathematical Thinking and Learning Series)</h2><p><p>In this important new book for pre- and in-service teachers, early math experts Douglas Clements and Julie Sarama show how "learning trajectories" help teachers become more effective professionals.

Some of this growth is due to the availability of powerful simulation-based algorithms to summarize posterior distributions. There has been also a growing interest in the use of the system R for statistical analyses. R's open source nature, free availability, and large number of contributor packages have made R the software of choice for many statisticians in education and industry.</p> <p>Bayesian Computation with R introduces Bayesian modeling by the use of computation using the R language. The early chapters present the basic tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and two-parameter inferential problems. Bayesian computational methods such as Laplace's method, rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are illustrated in the context of a random effects model. The construction and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced. These simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and binary response regression, hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference, and robust modeling. Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the posterior predictive distribution. The use of R to interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is described with several illustrative examples.</p> <p>This book is a suitable companion book for an introductory course on Bayesian methods and is valuable to the statistical practitioner who wishes to learn more about the R language and Bayesian methodology. The LearnBayes package, written by the author and available from the CRAN website, contains all of the R functions described in the book.</p> <p>The second edition contains several new topics such as the use of mixtures of conjugate priors and the use of Zellner&#x2019;s <em>g</em> priors to choose between models in linear regression. There are more illustrations of the construction of informative prior distributions, such as the use of conditional means priors and multivariate normal priors in binary regressions. The new edition contains changes in the R code illustrations according to the latest edition of the LearnBayes package.</p></p><p>The book is a concise presentation of a wide range of Bayesian inferential problems and the computational methods to solve them. The detailed and thorough presentation style, with complete R code for the examples, makes it a welcome companion to a theoretical text on Bayesian inference.... Smart students of statistics will want to have both R and Bayesian inference in their portfolio. Jim Albert&#39;s book is a good place to try out R while learning various computational methods for Bayesian inference.

Those volumes and Wordsworth&#39;s and Coleridge&#39;s other major poems were central to the Romantic period and remain classic texts in our own time. Wordsworth focuses on &#39;the essential passions of the heart&#39; and achieves a penetrating insight into love and death, solitude and community. Coleridge explores a more fantastic and dreamlike imagination and also writes poems of quiet, conversational meditation. Both poets look with a fresh and visionary eye at the human and the natural world. They examine the condition of men and women at the extreme edge of society; they are also subtle analysts of their own minds and the processes of introspection and memory.

We could not read literature in translation, it was argued, without asking ourselves if linguistic and cultural phenomena really were 'translatable' and exploring in some depth the concept of 'equivalence'.<br>When Susan Bassnett's <em>Translation Studies</em> appeared in the <em>New Accents</em> series, it quickly became the essential introduction to this new subject. Susan Bassnett tackles the crucial problems of translation and offers a history of translation theory, beginning with the ancient Romans and encompassing key twentieth-century structuralist work. She then explores specific problems of literary translation through a close, practical analysis of texts, and completes her book with extensive suggestions for further reading.<br>Twenty years after publication, the field of translation studies continues to grow. Updated for the second time, Susan Bassnett's <em>Translation Studies</em> remains essential reading for anyone new to the field.</p><p>Susan Bassnett is Professor of Comparative Literary Studies and Head of the Centre for British and Comparative Cultural Studies at the University of Warwick.&#39;Translation Studies provides an admirably informative introduction to a fascinating but complex subject.&#39; - The Observer</p><h2>Islam (Religions of the World Series)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> <i>Islam</i> is a concise and readable survey of the history of Islam from the birth of Muhammad in seventh century Arabia to the differing situations of Muslims throughout today's world.

The 19 poems in this collection can stand on their own; coupled with the outstanding artwork, the book becomes a treasure to the eye and ear. Selections by poets such as Myra Cohn Livingston, Lucille Clifton, Jack Prelutsky, and Nikki Giovanni perfectly capture friendship?the glee, the confidences shared, the occasional sadness. Written from a child's perspective, the lyrical poems explore relationships with peers, family members, and even pets. The selections are paired with meticulously detailed illustrations that represent a variety of seasons and scenes. Mavor uses fabric relief as her medium, incorporating soft sculpture, applique, embroidery, and actual objects (shells, small pebbles, wood pieces, etc.). All techniques are used to wonderful effect and many objects seem to jump off the page. A visual treat, this book will not linger long on library shelves.?Barbara McGinn, Oak Hill Elementary School, Severna Park, MD<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Mavor (Mary Had a Little Lamb, 1995, not reviewed) applies her intricate fabric relief artwork to a series of poems about friendship by Jack Prelutsky, Langston Hughes, Judith Viorst, Lucille Thomas, Beatrice Schenk de Regniers, Nikki Giovanni, Aileen Fisher, Lucille Clifton, and others. In a realm in which acorn caps are used as tidy doll-sized berets, Mavor's highly detailed applique, embroidery, wrapping, dyeing, soft sculpture, and found-object art displays an admirable range of peoples- -including the four-legged friends many consider part of the family, a situation cleverly recognized in Arthur Guiterman's poem ``Chums.'' The selection of poems has child-appeal; the illustrations require close scrutiny, and may entice into the fold those who don't usually read poetry.

And how have transformations of gender and genre affected literary representations of "woman," "man," "family," and "society"?<br><br>This final volume in Gilbert and Gubar's landmark three-part <i>No Man's Land: The Place of the Woman Writer in the Twentieth Century</i> argues that throughout the twentieth century women of letters have found themselves on a confusing cultural front and that most, increasingly aware of the artifice of gender, have dispatched missives recording some form of the "future shock" associated with profound changes in the roles and rules governing sexuality.<br><br>Divided into two parts, <i>Letters from the Front</i> is chronological in organization, with the first section focusing on such writers of the modernist period as Virginia Woolf, Zora Neale Hurston, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Marianne Moore, and H.D., and the second devoted to authors who came to prominence after the Second World War, including Gwendolyn Brooks, Sylvia Plath, Margaret Atwood, Toni Morrison, and A.S. Byatt.<br><br>Embroiled in the sex antagonism that Gilbert and Gubar traced in <i>The War of the Words</i> and in the sexual experimentations that they studied in <i>Sexchanges</i>, all these artists struggled to envision the inscription of hitherto untold stories on what H.D. called "the blank pages/of the unwritten volume of the new." Through the works of the first group, Gilbert and Gubar focus in particular on the demise of any single normative definition of the feminine and the rise of masquerades of "femininity" amounting to "female female impersonation." In the writings of the second group, the critics pay special attention to proliferating revisions of the family romance?revisions significantly inflected by differences in race, class, and ethnicity?and to the rise of masquerades of masculinity, or "male male impersonation."<br><br>Throughout, Gilbert and Gubar discuss the impact on literature of such crucial historical events as the Harlem Renaissance, the Second World War, and the "sexual revolution" of the sixties. What kind of future might such a past engender? Their book concludes with a fantasia on "The Further Adventures of Snow White" in which their bravura retellings of the Grimm fairy tale illustrate ways in which future writing about gender might develop.<br></p><p>This final volume in Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar&#39;s landmark trilogy argues that twentieth-century women of letters-from Virginia Woolf, Marianne Moore, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and H.D. to Zora Neale Hurston, Sylvia Plath, Toni Morrison, and Margaret Atwood-have found themselves on a confusing cultural front and have responded by dispatching &#39;missives&#39; on the profound changes in the roles and rules that govern sexuality.<b>Sandra M.

This division or "vertical split" appears in a person at odds with himself, a person who puzzles over, and even heartily dislikes, that parallel person who behaves in so repugnant a manner. In <i>Being of Two Minds</i>, Arnold Goldberg provides trenchant insight into such divided minds - their origins, their appearances, and their treatment. <br><br>Goldberg's inquiry into divided minds leads to a return to the psychoanalytic concept of disavowal, which forms the basis of the vertical split. Goldberg explores the developmental circumstances that tend to a reliance on disavowal, provides numerous examples of the emergence of disavowal in the treatment situation, and considers the therapeutic approaches through which disavowal may be addressed. He is especially perceptive in discussing the manner in which the therapist's own tendency to disavow may collusively interact with that of the patient. <br><br>Goldberg considers the full range of splits to which disavowal gives rise, from circumscribed instances of dissociation to the much-debated multiple personality disorders. He gives special attention to the role of the vertical split in patients with behavior disorders; here his thoughtful insights point to a treatment approach that significantly differs both from the simple ascription of a 'self disorder' and from the usual pedagogical emphasis on issues of self-control and/or punishment. As Goldberg shows, the repugnance felt by many therapists for offensive behaviors emanating from the patient's parallel self are frequently shared by the patient, who commonly despises misbehavior that he is unable to understand. <i>Being of Two Minds</i> begins to formulate just such understanding, to the great benefit of patient and therapist alike.</p><p><p>"Goldberg has once again produced a well-written book of great practical interest and centering on specific clinical problems and case vignettes that nicely illustrate both his point of view and his actual therapeutic practice. I not only highly recommend this book; I consider it mandatory reading for anyone engaging in psychotherapeutic work on a day-to-day basis."</p> <p>- Richard D. Chessick, M.D., Ph.D.</p> <p>&#x201c;In this treatise on the origins, development, and functions of the vertical split in health and illness, Goldberg does for disavowal what Freud did for repression.&nbsp; <em>Being of Two Minds</em> achieves a decisive advance in self psychology and is evidence of Goldberg&#x2019;s enormous erudition, prodigious reading across a variety of disciplines, and unusual capacity for seamless integration of widely differing sources of knowledge in a quintessentially psychoanalytic manner.&nbsp; This book is destined to become a classic.&#x201d;</p> <p>- Paul Ornstein, M.D., Professor of Psychoanalysis, University of Cincinnati</p> <p>"Arnold Goldberg's new book should be required reading for anyone seeking to understand character disturbances. He convincingly illuminates and illustrates the value of the concept of 'vertical split' for psychoanalytically based treatment. Goldberg writes with such clarity and clinical acumen that the reader can readily apply his ideas to clinical practice." </p> <p>- Amy Eldridge, Ph.D., Institute for Clinical Social Work, Chicago</p> <p>&#x201c;This is a deceptively unassuming book, rare in our field, from an analyst who knows his material so well that he can present it in the clearest of terms.&nbsp; In his effort to elucidate a central tenet in the self-psychological literature, the vertical split, Arnold Goldberg demonstrates, once again, that he is one of our most effective teachers, putting the concept of the split into every terms, illustrating it with succinct clinical problems, and repeating his observations in a variety of contexts . . . we can ask no more of a master teacher than that, by the end of the course, we find ourselves thinking as he does and so can begin to test out his hypotheses for ourselves.&nbsp; This book will do that for you.&nbsp; It is a remarkable accomplishment.&#x201d;</p> <p>- Henry F. Smith, <em>International Journal of Psychoanalysis</em></p> <p>&#x201c;In the summary at the end of this splendid volume, Goldberg explains that this is an old-fashioned book.&nbsp; Indeed it is:&nbsp; clear, explicit prose, jargon-free, rich in clinical examples, and drawing on a profound history of psychoanalysis without invoking the latest and most fashionable views in the field.&nbsp; As the title implies, the bulk of the book concerns itself with the vertical split, but it also presents many other observations about psychoanalytic process, technique, and values. . . . Its contents, along with the many rich side &#x2018;essays,&#x2019; provide a freshness of thinking combined with a remarkable knowledge of classical psychoanalytic thinking.&#x201d;</p> <p>- Harold R.

Featuring contributors from philosophy, religious studies, and theology, it is unified by the way in which many of the authors engage in sustained critical examination of one another's positions. John Hick's pluralism provides one focal point of the collection. Hick argues that all the major religious traditions make contact with the same ultimate reality, each encountering it through a variety of culturally shaped forms of thought and experience but all offering equally effective paths to salvation or liberation. Another central position is William P. Alston's defense of the Christian practice of forming beliefs about manifestations of God in response to experiences of divine presence or activity. Articles by Hick and Alston develop their arguments and other selections respond, criticizing or defending various aspects of one or both positions. Religious skepticism, religious exclusivism, religious inclusivism, and other perspectives are also represented. In the introduction, the editors suggest connections among the articles and report on additional exchanges between the contributors. <br> The only anthology that provides comprehensive coverage of the current philosophical debate about religious diversity, <em>The Philosophical Challenge of Religious Diversity</em> is ideal for courses and seminars on the philosophy of religion, philosophical theology, and world religions.<br></p><p>Philip L.

More than seventy army nurses survived five months of combat conditions in the jungles of Bataan and Corregidor before being captured, only to endure more than three years in prison camps. In all, nearly one hundred nurses became POWs. <p>Many of these army nurses were considered too vital to the war effort to be evacuated from the Philippines. Though receiving only half the salary of male officers of the same rank, they helped establish outdoor hospitals and treated thousands of casualties despite rapidly decreasing supplies and rations. After their capture, they continued to care for the sick and wounded throughout their internment in the prison camps. </p><p>This account of the nurses' imprisonment adds a vital chapter to the history of American personnel in the Pacific theater.

Based on a lifetime of research by the late Eugene Genovese (1930-2012), with an introduction and epilogue by Douglas Ambrose, The Sweetness of Life presents a penetrating study of slaveholders and their families in both intimate and domestic settings: at home; attending the theatre; going on vacations to spas and springs; throwing parties; hunting; gambling; drinking and entertaining guests, completing a comprehensive portrait of the slaveholders and the world that they built with slaves. Genovese subtly but powerfully demonstrates how much politics, economics, and religion shaped, informed, and made possible these leisure activities. A fascinating investigation of a little-studied aspect of planter life, The Sweetness of Life broadens our understanding of the world that the slaveholders and their slaves made; a tragic world of both &#39;sweetness&#39; and slavery.</p><p>American slaveholders used the wealth and leisure that slave labor provided to cultivate lives of gentility and refinement. This study provides a vivid portrait of slaveholders at home and at play as they built a tragic world of both &#39;sweetness&#39; and slavery.Eugene D. Genovese, one of the most significant and distinguished historians of his time, spent a lifetime studying the society of the Old South. His books include The Political Economy of Slavery 1967), The World the Slaveholders Made (1988), In Red and Black (1973), From Rebellion to Revolution (1992), The Slaveholders&#39; Dilemma (1992), A Consuming Fire (2009), and Roll, Jordan, Roll (1976), which was awarded the Bancroft Prize. With his wife, the late Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, he wrote Fruits of Merchant Capital (1983), The Mind of the Master Class (Cambridge, 2005), Slavery in White and Black (Cambridge, 2008), and Fatal Self-Deception (Cambridge, 2012). A past president of the Organization of American Historians, Genovese died in 2012.</p><h2>Light Moving in Time: Studies in the Visual Aesthetics of Avant-Garde Film</h2><p>To view a film is to see another's seeing mediated by the technology and techniques of the camera. By manipulating the cinematic apparatus in unorthodox ways, avant-garde filmmakers challenge the standardized versions of seeing perpetuated by the dominant film industry and generate ways of seeing that are truer to actual human vision.<br><br>Beginning with the proposition that the images of cinema and vision derive from the same basic elements&#x2014;light, movement, and time&#x2014;Wees argues that cinematic apparatus and human visual apparatus have significant properties in common. For that reason they can be brought into a dynamic, creative relationship which the author calls the dialectic of eye and camera. The consequences of this relationship are what Wees explores.<br><br>Although previous studies have recognized the visual bias of avant-garde film, this is the first to place the visual aesthetics of avant-garde film in a long-standing, multidisciplinary discourse on vision, visuality, and art.</p><p><b>William C.

The study presents extensive evidence showing that the famous exchange of telegrams between the artist Frederic Remington and newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst&#x2015;in which Hearst is said to have vowed to furnish the war with Spain&#x2015;almost certainly never took place.

In the course of his forty-year career, John Milton evolved from a prodigy to a blind prophet, from a philosophical aesthete to a Puritan rebel, and from a poet who proclaimed the triumph of reason to one obsessed with the intractability of sin. Throughout these transformations, he conceived his work as a form of prayer, written in the service of the supreme being.</p><p><b>John Milton</b> was born in London on December 9, 1608, and studied at the University of Cambridge. He originally planned to become a clergyman, but abandoned those ambitions to become a poet. Political in his writings, he served a government post during the time of the Commonwealth. In 1651, he went completely blind but he continued to write, finishing <b>Paradise Lost</b> in 1667, and <b>Paradise Regained</b> in 1671. He died in 1674.</p><h2>Principles of Human Anatomy</h2><p>Principles of Human Anatomy, a market-leading text through its many editions, successfully blends visual and textual elements to illuminate the complexities of human anatomy.

[It] succeeds as a meditation on the tension between the centrality of music in Booth's life, both inner and social, and its marginality. . . . It causes the reader to acknowledge the heterogeneity of the pleasures involved in making music; the satisfaction in playing well, the pride one takes in learning a difficult piece or passage or technique, the buzz in one's fingertips and the sense of completeness with the bow when the turn is done just right, the pleasure of playing with others, the comfort of a shared society, the joy of not just hearing, but making, the music, the wonder at the notes lingering in the air."&#x2014;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p><i>For the Love of It</i> is a story not only of one intimate struggle between a man and his cello, but also of the larger struggle between a society obsessed with success and individuals who choose challenging hobbies that yield no payoff except the love of it. <br><b>Wayne C.

McMillan</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Edinburgh. He is the author of <em>France and Women 1789-1914</em> (Routledge 2000), and <em>Twentieth Century France</em> (Arnold 1992).<br>`The 'received' narratives of modern French political history remain so powerful that it is difficult to escape them.'<br>French Studies</p><h2>Community: Seeking Safety in an Insecure World</h2><p>'Community' is one of those words that feels good: it is good 'to have a community', 'to be in a community'. And 'community' feels good because of the meanings which the word conveys, all of them promising pleasures, and more often than not the kind of pleasures which we would like to experience but seem to miss. <p><br> 'Community' conveys the image of a warm and comfortable place, like a fireplace at which we warm our hands on a frosty day. Out there, in the street, all sorts of dangers lie in ambush; in here, in the community, we can relax and feel safe. 'Community' stands for the kind of world which we long to inhabit but which is not, regrettably, available to us. Today 'community' is another name for paradise lost - but for a paradise which we still hope to find, as we feverishly search for the roads that may lead us there.</p> <p><br> But there is a price to be paid for the privilege of being in a community. Community promises security but seems to deprive us of freedom, of the right to be ourselves. Security and freedom are two equally precious and coveted values which could be balanced to some degree, but hardly ever fully reconciled. The tension between security and freedom, and between community and individuality, is unlikely ever to be resolved. We cannot escape the dilemma but we can take stock of the opportunities and the dangers, and at least try to avoid repeating past errors.</p> <p><br> In this important new book, Zygmunt Bauman takes stock of these opportunities and dangers and, in his distinctive and brilliant fashion, offers a much-needed reappraisal of a concept that has become central to current debates about the nature and future of our societies.</p></p><p><b>Zygmunt Bauman</b> is Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the Universities of Leeds and Warsaw."These books mark an important advance in Bauman's project. He seems to be trying to bring the intellectuals back into the game, twitting them for their passivity. Bauman wants social critics to take a more active role, taking a lead by showing how the relationships between individuals and society and between the private and public spheres may be rearticulated and the spirit of the <i>agora</i> restored to social and political life." <br> <p><b><i>British Journal of Sociology</i></b><br> </p> <p>"This book is an example of what social thought can be when it is carried out in terms of the highest of qualities. As such, it demands to be read for two reasons; first, because of the fascinating and new light it casts on otherwise well-worn debates and second, as a call to arms."<br> </p> <p><i><b>Contemporary Sociology</b></i><br> </p> <p>"Bauman's argument is convincing and well substantiated. This book forms an interesting and stimulating starting point for anyone wishing to dig deeper into this field".<br> </p> <p><i><b>Gary Pattison, University of Southampton.

With more than 1,000 illustrations, including 74 plates in full color.</p><p>In his design for the Brooklyn Bridge, John Roebling fused Egyptian and Gothic detail into his personal version of the Roman triumphal arch. Michelangelo conceived his muscular, expressive architecture as if it were sculpture. These engaging insights are typical of the fresh approach taken by two New York University professors in this heavily illustrated, 600-page survey of Western architecture. The authors focus on monumental structures within each epoch, and give stylistic detail priority over social or political context. Even so, they often make broad connections between buildings and people. For example, a comparison of Greek freestanding temples and Rome's imposing facades suggests a difference between the freedom-loving Athenians and a Roman society dominated by state power and state religion. From Etruscan ruins to Robert Venturi's juxtaposing of low vernacular with high art, this detailed, rewarding study measures innovation against continuity. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Technical Writing 101: A Real-World Guide to Planning and Writing Technical Documentation, Second Edition</h2><p>To succeed in technical writing, you need a lot more than just writing ability. <i>Technical Writing 101</i> details the skills you need as a technical writer, and it explains how to handle the pressures of tight deadlines and ever-changing product specifications. This valuable reference also describes the entire documentation process&#x2014;planning, writing, editing, indexing, and production. <p>This updated second edition features the latest information on single sourcing and a new chapter on how trends in structured authoring and Extensible Markup Language (XML) affect technical writers.</p></p><p>Have you ever thought: <p>"Hey, I'm a good writer. I wonder if tech writing would make sense for me?" </p><p>If so, this is the book for you. Technical Writing 101 is a concise handbook that describes what it really takes to make it as a technical writer. </p><p>Technical Writing 101 explains that in addition to writing ability, technical writers also need a grasp of technical subjects, planning and organizational skills, and the ability to extract information from sources, which often means coaxing information from harried product developers. Tact, diplomacy, persistence, and a good sense of humor are essential. </p><p>The second edition features updated information about single sourcing, which is the process of creating different types of content (for example, printed documents and web pages) from one set of files. Limited budgets force many documentation departments to rely on single sourcing, so an understanding of single-sourcing techniques is essential for prospective technical writers. </p><p>This edition also contains a new chapter about how structured authoring affects technical writing. Structured authoring is a publishing workflow that enforces consistent organization of content. For example, if you write a list, the list must have two or more items. If a list doesn't have at least two items, your text processing software displays an error. Structured authoring may seem intimidating at first, but Technical Writing 101 clearly describes the process and its many benefits. </p><p>If you're working toward a degree in technical writing, this book is a great complement to your more theoretical classes.</p><b>Alan S.

But where do these places&#x2015;these regions&#x2015;come from? What makes them so real? In this groundbreaking book a distinguished group of historians explores the concept of region in America, traces changes the idea has undergone in our national experience, and examines its meaning for Americans today.</p><p>Far from diminishing in importance, the authors conclude, regional differences continue to play a significant role in Americans' self-image. Regional identity, in fact, has always been fed by the very forces that many people think threaten its existence today: a central government, an aggressive economy, and connections with places beyond regional boundaries. Calling into question widely held notions about how Americans came to differ from one another and explaining why those differences continue to flourish, this iconoclastic study&#x2015;by scholars with differing regional ties&#x2015;will refresh and redirect the centuries-old discussion over Americans' conceptions of themselves.</p></p><p>&#39;All Over the Map&#39; makes a distinctive and valuable contribution, and it does so at a critical moment in our thinking about regionalism.&#39; --Michael Kammen, Cornel University<p><b>Edward L.

I can only hope that the importance of the subject may save me from that egotism which makes great things seem little and little things seem less in the narrating."<br><br>So wrote Thomas Wentworth Higginson about his role in one of the most compelling and fascinating episodes in the history of the United States. As the colonel of the first regiment of black men in the Union army during the Civil War, Higginson was an early, articulate, and powerful crusader for civil rights, and his journal and letters, collected for the first time in this volume, present some of the most extraordinary documents of the Civil War. <br><br>Higginson was a politically engaged intellectual at the forefront of radical antislavery, labor, and feminist causes. Born in 1823 to a formerly wealthy but still prominent Brahmin family, he became one of America's leading social activists and a prominent writer, minister, and reformer. With the publication in 1869 of his classic <i>Army Life in a Black Regiment</i>, which drew on this journal, Higginson became one of the most important chroniclers of the Civil War. <i>The Complete Civil War Journal and Selected Letters of Thomas Wentworth Higginson</i> is the first comprehensive edition of his journal. Sensitively and thoroughly annotated by Christopher Looby and supplemented by a large selection of Higginson's wartime letters, this volume offers the most vivid and intimate picture of the radical interracial solidarity brought about by the transformative experience of the army camp and of Civil War life. <br><br>"The immediacy of Higginson's reflections, as well as their sharp insights, make this journal both distinctive and enduringly compelling . . . . Higginson's vivid texts can once again educate, gratify and delight readers."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"This volume will enrich our understanding of the transformations that emancipation and war wrought."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>The lively and detailed wartime diary of the leader of the first black regiment to be formed in the Civil War offers a refreshingly uncensored portrait of life in the Union Army from an officer's point of view. Long an outspoken advocate of abolition, Higginson served for several years as the commanding officer of the First South Carolina Volunteers, a regiment composed largely of former slaves, meant to demonstrate that the black man, when given the opportunity, was as brave and capable as any white. In 1869, Higginson, drawing heavily on his diary, published Army Life in a Black Regiment, an essential account of African-American experience in the war. But the original journal format allows Higginson a greater frankness in discussing his men, his motivations, and wars weird mix of numbing routine and terror. Already a published essayist, Higginson made use of the privacy his diary offered to record candid assessments of other officers, and to capture the raw humor that develops among men in combat. His portraits of the soldiers (including, in some cases, anecdotes of their horrific experiences as slaves), of the routines of camp life (everything from picket duty to marriages and deaths), and of southern landscapes all have great impact. He is also amazingly frank about his divided feelings for his men. Higginson was prepared to give his life in the cause of emancipation, but he admitted to himself that he knew, and cared to know, few of his men well. His letters back home offer further fresh details about the war. And the clear and useful annotations and lengthy introduction by Looby (English/Univ. of Pennsylvania) place Higginson's experiences in a broader historical context. A model of how such material should be presented and a fascinating glimpse of a regiment that helped, by its formation and success, to make history. (12 halftones) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This journal, from which Higginson drew his celebrated memoir, Army Life in a Black Regiment, finally receives its deserved full publication. Higginson (1823-1911) was a minister, naturalist, ardent abolitionistAhe was one of the "secret six" who supported John BrownA and commander of the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, one of the Union's earliest forces of freed slaves during the Civil War. (He is also remembered as the principal correspondent of Emily Dickinson.) Providing needed definitions and identifications, Looby's edition also includes letters that throw further light on Higginson's principal concern: the rapidly changing relations between the two races during warfare in the South. The immediacy of Higginson's reflections, as well as their sharp insights, make this journal both distinctive and enduringly compelling. For example, he recorded the halting steps required of both blacks and whites, such as simply learning to call each other "Mr.," as both peoples grappled with the implications of manumission. The introduction by Looby (a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania) gives a somewhat literary and fashionable reading of the journal, throwing light it upon gender bending and homosocial behavior. A historian, however, would have emphasized Higginson's extraordinary effort to see his black soldiers and other former slaves as humans who, like himself, were trying to make sense of their rapidly changing world. Higginson's vivid texts can once again educate, gratify and delight readers. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kwakiutl art</h2><p>A DEFINITIVE STUDY OF INDIAN ART.</p><p></p><h2>The Dogs of War: 1861</h2><p>In 1861, Americans thought that the war looming on their horizon would be brief. None foresaw that they were embarking on our nation's worst calamity, a four-year bloodbath that cost the lives of more than half a million people. But as eminent Civil War historian Emory Thomas points out in this stimulating and provocative book, once the dogs of war are unleashed, it is almost impossible to rein them in. <br> In <em>The Dogs of War</em>, Thomas highlights the delusions that dominated each side's thinking. Lincoln believed that most Southerners loved the Union, and would be dragged unwillingly into secession by the planter class. Jefferson Davis could not quite believe that Northern resolve would survive the first battle. Once the Yankees witnessed Southern determination, he hoped, they would acknowledge Confederate independence. These two leaders, in turn, reflected widely held myths. Thomas weaves his exploration of these misconceptions into a tense narrative of the months leading up to the war, from the "Great Secession Winter" to a fast-paced account of the Fort Sumter crisis in 1861. <br> Emory M. Thomas's books demonstrate a breathtaking range of major Civil War scholarship, from <em>The Confederacy as a Revolutionary Experience</em> and the landmark <em>The Confederate Nation</em>, to definitive biographies of Robert E. Lee and J.E.B. Stuart. In <em>The Dogs of War</em>, he draws upon his lifetime of study to offer a new perspective on the outbreak of our national Iliad.<br></p><p><br><strong>Emory M. Thomas</strong> is Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Georgia. His books include <em>Robert E. Lee: A Biography, Bold Dragoon: The Life of J.E.B. Stuart</em>, and <em>The Confederate Nation, 1861-1865</em>.<br><br>"Intelligent and engaging. Thomas's musings will remind readers that wars should not be left to either generals or politicians alone. An instructive lesson recommended for any free people thinking they can control events, especially wars, simply because they think their cause is just."--<em>Library</em> <em>Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Screened Out: Playing Gay in Hollywood from Edison to Stonewall</h2><p>Rapacious dykes, self-loathing closet cases, hustlers, ambiguous sophisticates, and sadomasochistic rich kids: most of what America thought it knew about gay people it learned at the movies. A fresh and revelatory look at sexuality in the Great Age of movie making, <em>Screened Out</em> shows how much gay and lesbian lives have shaped the Big Screen. Spanning popular American cinema from the 1900s until today, distinguished film historian Richard Barrios presents a rich, compulsively readable analysis of how Hollywood has used and depicted gays and the mixed signals it has given us: Marlene in a top hat, Cary Grant in a negligee, a pansy cowboy in <em>The Dude Wrangler</em>. Such iconoclastic images, Barrios argues, send powerful messages about tragedy and obsession, but also about freedom and compassion, even empowerment.<br><br>Mining studio records, scripts, drafts (including cut scenes), censor notes, reviews, and recollections of viewers, Barrios paints our fullest picture yet of how gays and lesbians were portrayed by the dream factory, warning that we shouldn't congratulate ourselves quite so much on the progress movies - and the real world -- have made since Stonewall.<br><br>Captivating, myth-breaking, and funny, <em>Screened Out</em> is for all film aficionados and for anyone who has sat in a dark movie theater and drawn strength and a sense of identity from what they saw on screen, no matter how fleeting or coded.</p><p><strong>Richard Barrios,</strong> a native of Louisiana, lives in New York City.

His comments are shrewd and his coverage complete.

M. Coetzee examines the complexities of censorship beyond the model of villainous censor and victimized artist. Having lived in a police state, Coetzee&#39;s experience is that &#34;the same censors patrol the boundaries of both politics and esthetics.&#34; By contrast, in the United States, the way for artists to get away with representations that some find offensive or forbidden is to argue that their work has some political worth. Though Coetzee admits he doesn&#39;t know what to think of artists who &#34;break taboos and yet claim protection of the law,&#34; he remains committed to free speech, conscious of how easily oppressive righteousness can rear its viscous head.In Giving Offense, South African writer J. M. Coetzee presents a coherent, unorthodox analysis of censorship from the perspective of a writer who has lived and worked under its shadow. Widely acclaimed for his many novels, Coetzee is also a brilliant literary critic and essayist. The essays collected here attempt to understand the passion that plays itself out in acts of silencing and censoring. Subscribing neither to the myth of the writer as a moral giant nor to that of the writer as persecuted innocent, Coetzee argues that a destructive dynamic of belligerence and escalation tends to overtake the rivals in any field ruled by censorship. From Osip Mandelstam commanded to compose an ode in praise of Stalin, to Breyten Breytenbach writing poems under and for the eyes of his prison guards, to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn engaging in a trial of wits with the organs of the Soviet state, Giving Offense focuses on the ways authors have historically responded to censorship. It also analyzes the arguments of Catharine MacKinnon for the suppression of pornography and traces the operations of the old South African censorship system. Finally, Coetzee delves into the early history of apartheid and critizes the blankness of contemporary political science in its efforts to address the deeper motives behind apartheid.</p><h2>Synergetics 2: Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking</h2><p>Offers an alternative view of the classic physics of Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton and a fresh interpretation of Einstein&#39;s theories</p><p></p><h2>Mary: Seeing God through the Eyes of a Mother (Drawn In Bible Study)</h2><p><b>Color with Friends.

Bound in real cloth, printed on high quality paper, and featuring ribbon markers and gilt edges, Macmillan Collector's Library are books to love and treasure. </p><p><i>The Odyssey</i> can claim to be Western literature's first adventure story, and describes the ten-year wanderings of Odysseus in his quest to return home after the Trojan war. He encounters giants, sorceresses and sea-monsters before he can get home and then must remain in disguise while seeking a way to rid his home of the suitors who, believing him dead, have besieged his wife. Both an enchanting fairy tale and a gripping drama, <i>The Odyssey</i> is eminently readable, not least for the rich complexity and magnetism of its hero. </p><p>This translation is by T. E. Lawrence, with an Afterword by Ben Shaw.</p></p><p>The identity of the writer of the <i>Odyssey</i> is a matter of some speculation. The ancients were convinced it was Homer, although they tended to disagree as to biographical details. The best supported evidence suggests he lived in Chios, an island off the west coast of Turkey, some time between 1100 and 700BC, probably closer to the latter. Traditionally portrayed as revered, old and blind, he composed the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> and possibly the <i>Homeric Hymns</i>, a series of choral addresses to the gods.</p><h2>Introducing Romans: Critical Issues in Paul&#39;s Most Famous Letter</h2><p>Paul&#x2019;s Letter to the Romans has proven to be a particular challenge for commentators, with its many highly significant interpretive issues often leading to tortuous convolutions and even &#x201c;dead ends&#x201d; in their understanding of the letter.<br><br> Here, Richard N. Longenecker takes a comprehensive look at the complex backdrop of Paul&#x2019;s letter and carefully unpacks a number of critical issues, including:<br> * Authorship, integrity, occasion, date, addressees, and purpose<br> * Important recent interpretive approaches<br> * Greco-Roman oral, rhetorical, and epistolary conventions<br> * Jewish and Jewish Christian thematic and rhetorical features<br> * The establishing of the letter&#x2019;s Greek text<br> * The letter&#x2019;s main focus, structure, and argument<br></p><p>Richard N. Longenecker is professor emeritus of New Testament at Wycliffe College, University of Toronto.&#x201c;Longenecker addresses here the major questions about this intriguing letter, setting out his own views cogently and clearly, with fairness and respect for those with whom he disagrees, and drawing upon decades of research and reflection. Reasonable, clear, well-informed, and instructive in every chapter, this extensive introduction to Romans deserves a place in any scholarly collection on Paul&#x2019;s most-discussed letter.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015; Larry Hurtado<br> University of Edinburgh<br><br> &#x201c;A veteran interpreter of Paul here takes on issues &#x2015; some perennial, some of more recent focus &#x2015; important for understanding Paul&#x2019;s weightiest letter.

Her personal rebellion involves extending herself beyond the boundaries of style and manners, through reason and passion, to some comprehension of the obstacles and possibilities between people. In her poetry, Minnie Bruce Pratt has explored the capacity of words to expand and communicate her experiences; through her essays she examines this process and tests its limits. She writes of when she first discovered her "outsider" status as a lesbian: "I did not yet understand that to come to a place of greater liberation, I had to risk old safeties. Instead, I felt I had no place; that, as I moved through my days, I was falling through space." She uses insights into her own "loss of place" to explore the dynamics of privilege and difference in other contexts, crossing cultural, racial, political, religious, and sexual boundaries. Each essay in this collection approaches the writer's identity from a different angle, and each essay offers a challenge to assumptions concerning that identity. Minnie Bruce Pratt honors her readers with a trust: she takes us to the edge of her own understanding and invites us to go further with her, as well as on our own. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Kirsten Backstrom</i>Pratt's appropriately titled collection of essays reflects on what it is to be different in our primarily white, male-dominated society. Beginning with an essay on her childhood, she recounts growing up as a white middle-class girl in the South, socialized by the white, Christian male's notion of what a female should be. She writes, "I did not even think of what I and my mother and other women were doing when we agreed, silently, unconsciously, to wear shoes of a certain style in certain places, to walk only in certain places at certain times, to accept without much question what was going on outside our home, the doings of white men . . . ." She also describes the ostracism she experienced as a mother who had her sons taken away from her when she chose to love another woman, noting that society simply would not, could not tolerate her or anyone else being different. Pratt has something to say about the contradictions in our society and her sensitivity is acute and justified. She is at times long-winded, but her insights are truly brilliant and deserve to be heard. For women's studies collections.<br><i>- Patricia A. Sarles, Mt. Sinai Medical Ctr.

Sailing first to China, Hyecho continued to what is today Vietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, before taking the Silk Road and heading back east, where he ended his days on the sacred mountain of Wutaishan in China.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With <i>Hyecho&#x2019;s Journey</i>, eminent scholar of Buddhism Donald S.

Along the way, Lopez introduces key elements of Buddhism, including its basic doctrines, monastic institutions, works of art, and the many stories that have inspired Buddhist pilgrimage. Through the eyes of one remarkable Korean monk, we discover a vibrant tradition flourishing across a vast stretch of Asia. <i>Hyecho&#x2019;s Journey</i> is simultaneously a rediscovery of a forgotten pilgrim, an accessible primer on Buddhist history and doctrine, and a gripping, beautifully illustrated account of travel in a world long lost.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Donald S.

Recommended.&#x201d; (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>"With his co-authors, Donald Lopez has written a book that envisions Buddhism around the 8th century &#x2013;and beyond&#x2013; in quite a different way than the standard historical narratives: by using a combination of the record of the rather unknown Sino-Korean Buddhist traveller Hyecho and selected pieces of Buddhist art the authors explore the dimensions of space and materiality of Buddhism rather than exclusively focusing on event history. The result is a fascinating kaleidoscope of the Buddhist world stretching from the Eastern regions of the Near East to the Far East."

This was an age of cultural globalization: in the third century BC, a single language carried you from the Rhone to the Indus. A Celt from the lower Danube could serve in the mercenary army of a Macedonian king ruling in Egypt, and a Greek philosopher from Cyprus could compare the religions of the Brahmins and the Jews on the basis of first-hand knowledge of both. Kings from Sicily to Tajikistan struggled to meet the challenges of ruling multi-ethnic states, and Greek city-states came together under the earliest federal governments known to history.

A historian can deal with it as a study of multicultural social and religious structures,...as Thonemann (Wadham College, Oxford) has done in this excellent brief book, as a historical sketch followed by glimpses of various aspects of the period. Next comes Hellenistic science, with the polymath Eratosthenes as illustration. The book moves on to encounters on the boundaries with India, the Russian steppe, and Italy, where Herculaneum has yielded a Hellenistic-type grand house: the Villa of the Papyri.

Tracing the modern photographic portrait over the past 150 years, the book reveals the many ways the photographic arts have investigated, represented, interpreted, and subverted the human face and, consequently, the human spirit. Artists have used the genre not only to convey familiar emotions such as fear, love, sadness, and anger, but also to explore complex subjective states such as passionate individuality and psychological withdrawal. Different avant-garde movements have enlisted farce, masks, and masquerade in their charting of the human character, and many postmodern works employ irony and ambiguity to deal with issues of identity, gender, and dissociation.</p><p>The book, which accompanies an exhibition opening at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in October 1999, is organized roughly chronologically around the traditional, modernist, and postmodernist views of the face, although the primary approach of one period often appears in the others. The artists discussed include, among others, Diane Arbus, Julia Margaret Cameron, Edward Curtis, Salvador Dali, Duchenne de Boulogne, Dorothea Lange, Annie Leibowitz, Bruce Nauman, Orlan, William Parker, Irving Penn, Lucas Samaras, Cindy Sherman, Andy Warhol, and Edward Weston.</p><p>Published in cooperation with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p></p><p>&#34;In this book Sobieszek presents a wide-ranging study of the camera portrait as a reflection and catalyst of cultural beliefs about human nature. He demonstrates that photographed faces over the past 150 years - whether on silver plates, in fashion shots, or in video stills - raise questions of essence and appearance that also lie behind activities as varied as philosophy, fiction, painting, psychiatry, film, forensics, anthropology, masquerade, gender studies, and plastic surgery.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. &#34;The book&#39;s three essays explore traditional, modern, and postmodern approaches to the camera portrait. &#34;&#39;Gymnastics of the Soul&#39;: The Clinical Aesthetics of Duchenne de Boulogne&#34; investigates the nineteenth-century certainty that, in the words of Arthur Schopenhauer, &#34;the outer person is a picture of the inner.&#34; This belief was pursued in physiognomy, phrenology, and pathognomy, popular pseudosciences of the day that were the culmination of a long tradition including the work of Giambauista della Porta, Charles Le Brun, and Johann Kaspar Lavater. Modernism brought an apparent end to these pursuits through a new awareness of the subjectivity inherent in the use of the camera. In &#34;&#39;Tolerances of the Human Face&#39;: The Affectless Surfaces of Andy Warhol, &#34; the author places Warhol&#39;s photo-silkscreened portraits in the modern contexts of social and anthropological classification and the symbolism of fame, but suggests that physiognomy has not been entirely silenced. Finally, &#34;&#39;Abstract Machines of Faciality&#39;: The Dramaturgical Identities of Cindy Sherman&#34; explores the theatrical aspects of portraiture, tracing a continuum that links Sherman&#39;s work to the demonstrations of hysteria staged by thenineteenth-century French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, Surrealist masks, performance art, and the use of schizophrenia and multiple selves as metaphors for the postmodern human condition.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. &#34;The photographs collected here - works by Diane Arbus, Julia Margaret Cameron, Edward Curtis, Salvador Dali, Dorothea Lange, Annie Leibowitz, Bruce Nauman, Orlan, William Parker, Irving Penn, Lucas Samaras, Edward Weston, and many others - show how vividly the photographic arts have kept up with the motions of the human soul and contributed to our perception of being.&#34;--BOOK JACKET.Robert A.

For seven months in 1880, he surprised and amused the readers of New Orleans with his wood-block &#x201c;cartoons&#x201d; and accompanying articles, which were variously funny, scathing, surreal, political, whimsical, and moral. This delightful book collects in their entirety, for the first time, all of the extant satirical columns and woodcut illustrations published in the <i>Daily City Item</i>&#x2015;181 columns in all. Hearn displays immense range, illuminating in words and prints the unique culture of New Orleans, including its Creole history, debauched underworld, corrupt politicians, and <i>voudou</i> practitioners. The columns are expertly annotated by Delia LaBarre, who places them in their unique Crescent City context.</p><p> With virtually no training in art of any kind, Hearn began creating his illustrations partly to boost the circulation of a small daily newspaper in a competitive market. He believed in the power of satirical cartoons to communicate big ideas in small spaces&#x2015;in particular, to reveal the habits, prejudices, and delusions of the current generation. Blind in his left eye (since a boyhood accident) and severely myopic in his right, Hearn nonetheless painstakingly carved out drawings on wood blocks with a penknife to be printed alongside his articles on the newspaper&#x2019;s letterpress. Hearn developed, from the first of these woodcuts to the last, a unique style that expressed the full range of his wit, from razor-sharp condemnation to tender affection.</p><p> Hearn had a keen eye for the absurd, along with an extraordinary ability to modulate his criticism and praise in a continuum from cauterizing vitriol to palliative balm, from the heaviest sarcasm to the lightest wit. In the pieces collected here, there can be found a unifying thread: Hearn&#x2019;s love/hate relationship with the virtues and vices of New Orleans, a city that continually amused and amazed him.</p><p> Born in Greece and raised in Ireland, Lafcadio Hearn immigrated to the United States as a teenager and became a newspaper reporter in Cincinnati, Ohio. When he married a black woman, an act that was illegal at the time, the newspaper fired him and Hearn relocated to New Orleans. In the early 1880s his contributions to national publications (like <i>Harper&#x2019;s Weekly</i> and <i>Scribners Magazine</i>) helped mold the popular image of New Orleans as a colorful place of decadence and hedonism. In 1888, Hearn left New Orleans for Japan, where he took the name Koizumi Yakumo and worked as a teacher, journalist, and writer. </p><p> &#x201c;And it may come to pass that I shall have stranger things to tell you; for this is a land of magical moons and of witches and of warlocks; and were I to tell you all that I have seen and heard in these years in this enchanted City of Dreams you would verily deem me mad rather than morbid.&#x201d;&#x2015;Lafcadio Hearn, 1880, describing New Orleans in a letter to a friend</p></p><p>Delia Labarre is editor of the 2003 edition of Hearn&#x2019;s novel <i>Chita: A Memory of Last Island </i>and is founder of the Lafcadio Hearn/Koizumi International Center in New Orleans.</p><h2>Kumon Grade 4 Division (Kumon Math Workbooks)</h2><p>Most grade-school workbooks try to cover the full range of topics in one workbook, and as a result do not dedicate enough pages to important mathematical concepts.

As often as I have read it, and fumbled it over, it now excites fresh admiration that this work has excited so little interest in the literary world. As splendid an edition of it as the art of printing can produce&#x2014;as well for the intrinsic merit of the work, as for the proof it brings of the bitter sufferings of the advocates of liberty from that time to this, and to show the slow progress of moral, philosophical, and political illumination in the world&#x2014;ought to be now printed in America.</i></p> <p>&#x2014;John Adams to Thomas Jefferson (1823)</p> <p>Written in response to Sir Robert Filmer's <i>Patriarcha</i> (1680), the <b><i>Discourses Concerning Government</i></b> by Algernon Sidney (1623&#x2013;1683) has been treasured for more than three centuries as a classic defense of republicanism and popular government.</p> <p>Sidney rejected Filmer's theories of royal absolutism and divine right of kings, insisting that title to rule should be based on merit rather than birth; and republics, he thought, were more likely to honor merit than were monarchies. Like John Milton, Sidney revered and idealized the Commonwealth (1649&#x2013;1660) as England's noble achievement in the grand tradition of ancient Greece and Rome.</p> <p>Sidney's treatise was published posthumously in 1698, fifteen years after he was executed for complicity in a plot to assassinate Charles II. Sidney's papers, including a draft of the <b><i>Discourses,</i></b> were used as evidence against him. Although there is nothing in the work incompatible with constitutional monarchy, the indictment claimed that it was a "false, seditious, and traitorous libel," citing sentences which stated that the king is subject to law and is responsible to the people.</p> <p>Sidney's <b><i>Discourses</i></b> was widely read in the colonies and influenced a number of American revolutionary leaders.</p> <p><b>Thomas G.

The text integrates simple mathematics so students can see the practicality of physics and have means of testing its validity. Throughout the text, Ostdiek and Bord emphasize the relevance of physics to our daily lives. Students will find applied examples throughout the chapters, such as music synthesizers, liquid mirror telescopes, and nuclear-powered spacecraft. The text also periodically reviews the historical development of physics, material that has proven popular with liberal-arts majors using earlier editions.</p><p>Vern Ostdiek was an Associate Professor at Benedictine College, where he had a joint appointment in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. In addition to teaching courses in physics, mathematics, and computer science, he oversaw the Computer Discovery Lab. Vern was named Benedictine College's Educator of the Year in 1999. His research interests centered on the nocturnal dynamics of the lower part of the Earth's atmosphere. Past research topics include noctilucent clouds and frontal zones.<br><br>Don Bord is Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Michigan, Dearborn. Prior to his appointment ay UMD in 1984, he taught at Benedictine College in Atchison, KS, where his collaboration with Vern Ostdiek led to the development and publication of INQUIRY INTO PHYSICS, now to appear in its 7th Edition. Don has an abiding interest in physics and astronomy education, particularly as it pertains to laboratory instruction, and he has published several articles in The American Journal of Physics, The Physics Teacher, and Sky and Telescope in this area. He was also co-editor, with Clint Sprott, of the first edition of Great Ideas for Teaching Physics. Don's research focuses on determining the abundance of heavy and rare-earth elements in chemically peculiar stars and the Sun using high-resolution spectra. To support this effort, he has also performed ab initio atomic structure calculations to determine energy levels, oscillator strengths, and partition functions for many of the ions of interest. This work has involved collaborators from around the world, particularly those at the European Southern Observatory and the University of Vienna, as well as UMD undergraduates, and it has appeared in such journals as Physica Scripta, Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Solar Physics. He has been a recent participant in a reverberation mapping project lead by colleagues at The Ohio State University to establish black hole masses in active galactic nuclei. Don has also been active in campus administration, having served as department chair, associate dean for planning and faculty development, and interim dean of the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters. In 2008, he was named Interim Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at UMD, and currently serves as Associate Provost. He was the first recipient of the University of Michigan's Jacqueline Lawson Award for his contributions in the area of faculty governance."This is my favorite book for this course."<br><br>"I highly prefer INQUIRY INTO PHYSICS over all the other leading texts available at this level because it has a few but not too many formulas: Ostdiek/Bord carefully introduce about 5 easy equations per chapter. I believe this is absolutely necessary because a first contact with interesting algebra early is highly desirable, especially for students who take a first introductory science course. A purely phenomenological text may make easy reading but it does not serve students well as they get the dangerous impression that they can do good science without any quantitative reasoning."</p><h2>Mapping Social Relations: A Primer in Doing Institutional Ethnography</h2><p>This is a book about a distinctive methodological approach inspired by one of Canada? s most respected scholars, Dorothy Smith. Institutional ethnography aims to answer questions about how everyday life is organized. What is conventionally understood as ? the relationship of micro to macro processes? is, in institutional ethnography, conceptualized and explored in terms of ruling relations.The authors suggest that institutional ethnographers must adopt a particular research stance, one that recognizes that people? s own knowledge and ways of knowing are crucial elements of social action and thus of social analysis. Specific attention to text analysis is integral to the approach as is a sensitive to gender relations. <br><br>Institutional ethnography is remarkably well suited to the human service curriculum and the training of professionals and activists. Its strategy for learning how to understand problems existing in everyday life appeals to many researchers who are looking for guidance on how to take practical action. At the same time, the highly elaborated theoretical foundation of institutional ethnography is difficult to deal with in the brief time most students are in the classroom. The authors successfully tackle the issue of teaching and applying institutional ethnography. Campbell and Gregor have been testing out instructional methods and materials for many years. Mapping Social Relations is the product of that effort.</p><p><b>Marie L.

Especially a conscious year spent consistently doing something that you love, need, or want to cultivate in your life.<br>The truth is, most people rarely set out, purposefully, to spend 365 days doing something nourishing - something just for themselves - with a commitment to mark the changes that arise in their lives.

My heart is full of gratitude for this gift."</li></ul>If a year seems too long, consider that it's taken far longer than a year to build up the stressful patterns that afflict us all on a regular basis. Stress - and stuff - doesn't grow overnight, and releasing it takes time. It takes time to rewire the brain that instantly goes into fight-or-flight. It takes time to soften resistances to new ways of being. It takes time grow new habits that feel really good and create lasting change. Yes, I'm talking about a journey and a way of life. not just a destination with a set goal and outcome. And unless we go on the journey, and stick with it, we cannot fully know what our higher self wants to teach us.

The events of the day are narrated and these show beyond all doubt the brilliant success of disciplined British mass-firepower against the charges of the French. The book also pays attention to other Allied armies, including Dutch/Belgian troops brought to the field by Prince William of Orange and the Prussians under Blucher. Excellent colour plates accompany the descriptions of both these troops and their French counterparts. An excellent sense of the closeness of the battle is given - Wellington himself claimed that it was the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life - and this gripping account shows the full justice of that statement.</p></p><p>The Bringing History to Life collection is made up of Osprey&#39;s all-time favourite titles, re-released with striking new covers - selected titles also include visitor information sections.<p>GEOFFREY WOOTTEN is an acknowledged expert on the Napoleonic period and has written a number of articles and books on the subject.</p></p><h2>Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured (Orange Book)</h2><p>A legend in EMS education just got better!<br><br>In 1971, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) published the first edition of Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured and created the backbone of EMS education.

It is called the Homocysteine Theory and is the medical breakthrough that inspired Andrew Weil to label Dr. McCully as &#34;a visionary medical pioneer well ahead of his time&#34;. This discovery has the potential to save millions, yet ironically destroyed Dr. McCully&#39;s medical career. Homocysteine, a byproduct of metabolism, has been discovered to be a better risk indicator of heart disease than high cholesterol. A simple B6 vitamin and folic acid play a major role in controlling homocysteine levels. This proven theory will change the way the medical establishment views and treats heart disease. Today, the medical community is beginning to accept Dr. McCully&#39;s findings transforming his story from medical heresy to legitimate medicine. Updated and revised, complete with a new introduction by Walter Wilett, this eye opening book combines Dr. McCully&#39;s personal story and scientific philosophy with a fascinating exposition of his discovery and a special program to make use of this information to improve overall health.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Household Spanish</h2><p>This updated language-learning book presents an informal, user-friendly Spanish course for non-Spanish speakers who need to learn fundamental words and expressions in Spanish in order to communicate with Latino employees in the household or workplace.

As the sacrifice is performed, the worshipper is incorporated into the god of his class. Thus he draws on divine power to sustain the social order of which his action is a part, and in which his own place is determined by the degree of his resemblance to his god. The key to Hawaiian society&#x2014;and a central focus for Valeri&#x2014;is the complex and encompassing sacrificial ritual that is the responsibility of the king, for it displays in concrete actions all the concepts of pre-Western Hawaiian society.

Sula Peace leaves Medallion to experience college, men, and life in the big city, an exceptional choice for a black woman to make in the late 1920s. <p>As girls, Nel and Sula are the best of friends, only children who find in each other a kindred spirit to share in each girl's loneliness and imagination. When they meet again as adults, it's clear that Nel has chosen a life of acceptance and accommodation, while Sula must fight to defend her seemingly unconventional choices and beliefs. But regardless of the physical and emotional distance that threatens this extraordinary friendship, the bond between the women remains unbreakable: "Her old friend had come home.... Sula, whose past she had lived through and with whom the present was a constant sharing of perceptions.

He situates the Arawet� in contemporary anthropology as a people whose vision of the world is complex, tragic, and dynamic, and whose society commands our attention for its extraordinary openness to exteriority and transformation. For the Arawet� the person is always in transition, an outlook expressed in the mythology of their gods, whose cannibalistic ways they imitate. <i>From the Enemy's Point of View</i> argues that current concepts of society as a discrete, bounded entity which maintains a difference between "interior" and "exterior" are wholly inappropriate in this and in many other Amazonian societies.<br> </p></p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: Portugese</p><h2>Understanding To Kill a Mockingbird: A Student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historic Documents (The Greenwood Press &#34;Literature in Context&#34; Series)</h2><p><p>To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel of such profound power that it has affected the lives of readers and left and indelible mark on American culture.

Among the documents which speak most eloquently are testimony from the Scottsboro Case of the 1930s, memoirs and interviews with African Americans and whites who grew up in Alabama in the 1930s, and news stories on civil rights activities in Alabama in the 1950s. Most of the documents presented are available in no other printed form. Study questions, project ideas, and bibliographies are also included for ease of use in further examination of the issues raised by the novel. Thirteen historical photographs complement the text.</p><p></p><p>Following a literary analysis of issues raised by the novel, the casebook opens with testimony and newspaper articles from the 1930s Alabama Scottsboro Case. The significant parallels of this case to the novel paint a social and historical background of the novel. Memoirs and interviews with African Americans and whites who grew up in Alabama in the 1930s further complete the historical landscape. Articles and news stories from the 1950s depict the increasingly tense, volatile environment in which the novel was written and published. Documents examine the stereotypes of the poor white, the African American, and the southern belle; and how the novel allows the reader to walk around in the shoes of those who have been stereotyped. More current articles examine the legal, literary, and ethical ramifications of the novel. These articles include a debate between lawyers over whether Atticus Finch was a hero, and discussion of attempts to censor the novel.</p></p><p><p>&#x2026;will be useful to teachers and student researchers, as a journey toward a richer understanding of Lee's novel and the complex ideas society is still exploring. <i>VOYA</i></p><p>CLAUDIA DURST JOHNSON is Professor of English at the University of Alabama, where she chaired the English Department for 12 years.

The Woman of Andros. The Self-Tormentor. The Eunuch (Loeb Classical Library No. 22)</h2><p><p>Terence brought to the Roman stage a bright comic voice and a refined sense of style. His six comedies--first produced in the half dozen years before his premature death in 159 BCE--were imaginatively reformulated in Latin plays written by Greek playwrights, especially Menander. For this new Loeb Classical Library edition of Terence, John Barsby gives us a faithful and lively translation with full explanatory notes, facing a freshly edited Latin text.</p><p>Volume I contains a substantial introduction and three plays: <i>The Woman of Andros</i>, a romantic comedy; <i>The Self-Tormentor</i>, which looks at contrasting father-son relationships; and <i>The Eunuch</i>, whose characters include the most sympathetically drawn courtesan in Roman comedy. The other three plays are in Volume II: <i>Phormio</i>, a comedy of intrigue with an engaging trickster; <i>The Mother-in-Law</i>, unique among Terence's plays in that the female characters are the admirable ones; and <i>The Brothers</i>, which explores contrasting approaches to parental education of sons.</p><p>The Romans highly praised Terence--"whose speech can charm, whose every word delights," in Cicero's words. This new edition of his plays, which replaces the now outdated Loeb translation by John Sargeaunt (first published in 1912), succeeds in capturing his polished style and appeal.</p></p><p><p>John Barsby is Professor of Classics at the University of Otago, New Zealand.</p>Text: English, Latin (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Anger: Facing the Fire Within (Hope for the Heart)</h2><p><p>Biblical Counseling on Anger Management from Hope for the Heart</p> <p>Has anger or rage ever clouded your judgment to the point that you acted rashly and then regretted it later?

Many of Hollywood's greatest directors such as Fritz Lang and Robert Siodmak are now closely associated with film noir's psychologically acute observations of the darker contours of the American urban landscape.

The book goes beyond the classical canon to examine the ways in which noir continues to have a diverse influence on American cinema. It demonstrates the way that noir has intervened in other more established Hollywood genres and also considers numerous lesser-known examples of the field.

Voice found or not, every one of the stories here is readable and entertaining today because of Sturgeon&#39;s singular gifts for clever turns of phrase and compelling narrative. As Samuel R. Delaney emphasizes in an insightful introduction, Sturgeon was the single most influential SF writer from the 1940s through the 1960s.</p><p>Theodore Sturgeon was born on February 26, 1918 in Staten Island, New York.

We both left home around the age of 16, with no support, inheritance, or stipend, and yet we were still able to make it in the world.<br><br> We raised three children, our greatest legacy, and started a series of successful businesses, either from scratch or with money I borrowed first from a credit card and later, when we had a bit of a track record, from local, community banks. Most of those businesses still exist; we long ago sold our shares and moved on, taking our retirement &#x201c;in installments,&#x201d; in the model of John D. MacDonald&#x2019;s Travis McGee (we lived at slip 18 in a houseboat community in Portland, Oregon).<br><br> Louise and I were fortunate to have come of age in the 1960s in America. We had a quarter-century of incredible opportunity before the ideologies and the policies of political and economic predators began dismantling the American Dream for all but those Thomas Jefferson referred to as &#x201c;the well born and the well bred.&#x201d;<br><br> Our parents remembered World War II (Louise&#x2019;s dad was in the US Navy, mine in the US Army), and both her dad and mine used the GI Bill and the Federal Housing Administration and other &#x201c;big government&#x201d; programs to leverage themselves into the middle class. Her father went through law school on the GI Bill and ended up an assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan, after coming from a home of poverty in Detroit. My father&#x2019;s story is told in this book. Our parents also remembered the Republican Great Depression of the 1930s, albeit as children, and our grandparents told us both many stories of life in those days and the lessons they learned from it.<br><br> Just 40 years ago, Louise worked her way through college as a waitress at a Howard Johnson&#x2019;s and I as a minimum-wage DJ (neither of us graduated, but that&#x2019;s another story unrelated to economics). I picked apples in White Cloud, Michigan, with migrant workers one summer; worked in a gas station; and washed dishes at Bob&#x2019;s Big Boy while I was spinning records at WITL and WVIC. That was enough to cover the cost of higher education in the late sixties. My friends who moved to pre-Reagan California were able to attend the University of California system&#x2014;one of the world&#x2019;s best&#x2014;for free.<br><br> Student debt? The idea was alien to Americans for most of our history, until the predators got into the system, for-profit colleges began to proliferate (their students are about twice as likely to default as students of nonprofit and state institutions), and banksters decided to get into the education business. Last year student loan debt in America exceeded credit card debt for the first time in history&#x2014;more than $1 trillion. It&#x2019;s creating a generation of serfs for the multinational corporations&#x2014;kids so afraid to challenge or leave their employers that they are little better off than the indentured workers who came here in the nineteenth century from Europe and lived lives of near-poverty and insecurity.<br><br> When Louise and I began our family, we were debt-free&#x2014;broke, but debt-free. Today the system&#x2019;s rigged so that young people can&#x2019;t even imagine such a thing, and banksters are making billions on student loans.<br><br> * * *<br><br> I remember sitting with Louise and our son almost two decades ago, as a psychologist ticked off the symptoms of attention-deficit disorder (ADD). With each one I thought, That&#x2019;s me, too! And then he told my son, who was just hitting his teenage years, that ADD was such a serious mental problem&#x2014;a &#x201c;disorder&#x201d; and a &#x201c;deficiency&#x201d;&#x2014;that instead of pursuing his passion, a career in science, he should consider car mechanics.<br><br> &#x201c;Be sure to work on foreign-made, high-end cars,&#x201d; the well-meaning doc said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where the money is. You wouldn&#x2019;t believe how much they charge to fix my Mercedes!&#x201d;<br><br> My son was in tears, and I was outraged.<br><br> This experience led to several years of intense research. I took with me the background of having been executive director for five years of a residential treatment facility for emotionally disturbed and abused children, most of whom had some sort of &#x201c;hyperactive&#x201d; or ADD-like diagnosis. I developed the firm conviction and gathered some solid evidence suggesting that ADD wasn&#x2019;t a disorder at all&#x2014;a hypothesis that has now been well corroborated. It led to my writing seven books on ADD, most about kids but one&#x2014;Focus Your Energy: Hunting for Success in Business with Attention Deficit Disorder&#x2014;specifically about how adults with ADD could be more successful than their &#x201c;nonafflicted&#x201d; peers.<br><br> As for our son, he recently graduated with a master&#x2019;s degree in the biological sciences.<br><br> Realizing the power that came from simply reframing a story, I moved my attention to the stories we all tell ourselves about the world and our relationship to it. That led to my book The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight: Waking Up to Personal and Global Transformation, in which I come to the conclusion that it&#x2019;s not our behavior that&#x2019;s killing us and so much life on the planet; it&#x2019;s not our technology or even our wasteful ways of living. All of these are just symptoms that derive from our stories, which over the millennia have become, in many cases, highly dysfunctional. Only by changing our stories&#x2014;our understanding of our relationship to everyone and everything else&#x2014;can we stop the destruction and begin the process of healing our planet and ourselves.<br><br> The biggest collection of controlling stories, of course, comes from religion and politics. The former has been a lifelong fascination that led to my writing The Prophet&#x2019;s Way: A Guide to Living in the Now, a book chiefly about my spiritual mentor, Gottfried M�ller, who passed away a few years ago at the age of 93, leaving behind the international Salem work.<br><br> I&#x2019;d largely ignored the political stories for most of my adult life, outside of my Students for a Democratic Society years in the sixties and lengthy discussions/debates with my Republican father. But after Louise and I sold our last business in Atlanta and moved to rural Vermont, we drove to Michigan to visit family for Thanksgiving. All the way there, we searched the radio dial for an intelligent conversation to listen to, but city after city all we found was Sean Hannity at a Habitat for Humanity site (he called it &#x201c;Hannity for Humanity&#x201d;), telling us that no &#x201c;liberal&#x201d; was ever going to live in the house they were helping build.<br><br> It was a bizarre experience. Having worked in radio back in the sixties and seventies, I wrote an article, &#x201c;Talking Back to Talk Radio,&#x201d; about how liberal talk radio might succeed, if done right. Sheldon and Anita Drobney read my article online, and as Sheldon noted in his book The Road to Air America: Breaking the Right Wing Stranglehold on Our Nation&#x2019;s Airwaves (in which he reprints the article), it became the first template for a business plan for that ultimately ill-fated network.<br><br> But rather than wait the almost two years it took the Drobneys to launch Air America, Louise and I, with the help of a local radio guy and friend, Rama Schneider, looked around the state and found a station in Burlington, Vermont, that was willing to put us on the air. The slot was Saturday mornings at 10 a.m., right after the swap-and-shop, so many of our callers, instead of discussing politics, wanted to know, &#x201c;Is that John Deere still available?&#x201d;<br><br> Ed Asner was kind enough to come on as a guest, helping us make a tape that caught the interest of the i.e. America Radio Network run out of Detroit by the United Auto Workers. Suddenly, broadcasting from our living room in Montpelier, Vermont, with a studio I&#x2019;d thrown together mostly from parts bought on eBay, we were on the air nationally, including Sirius, taking on Rush Limbaugh (and beating him in some markets) in the noon&#x2013;to&#x2013;3 p.m. slot ever since.<br><br> When we bought our house in Montpelier, we found in the attic a 20-volume set of the collected writings of Thomas Jefferson, published in 1909 and badly water damaged but still quite readable. I spent almost two years immersed in that incredible man&#x2019;s brain, from his autobiography to his letters to his work as president. Inspired, I wrote two books: What Would Jefferson Do?: A Return to Democracy and Unequal Protection: How Corporations Became &#x201c;People&#x201d;&#x2014;and How You Can Fight Back.<br><br> Applying the lessons of nearly a decade spent in the whirlwind of national and international politics, I wrote Rebooting the American Dream: 11 Ways to Rebuild Our Country, one of my favorite books. In 11 chapters Rebooting follows a model Alexander Hamilton first used to set forth 11 steps we could take to restore and rebuild this once-great nation. Combining my experience and training in psychology and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), I wrote Cracking the Code: How to Win Hearts, Change Minds, and Restore America&#x2019;s Original Vision, a book on political messaging and strategy. And I&#x2019;ve been watching how the first few years of the Obama administration have not produced the core true changes necessary in our trade, industrial, and fiscal structures. I&#x2019;m so convinced we&#x2019;re staring down the barrel of another disastrous Great Depression that I&#x2019;m working on a book about that right now.<br><br> I once read that wisdom is the result of knowledge tempered and shaped by experience. This year is my sixtieth on this planet, and while I&#x2019;m loath to call myself wise, over the past decade I&#x2019;ve begun to understand the concept in a way I never could have when I was younger. Wisdom requires that an arc of history be both superimposed on knowledge and lived. I mention this not so much in my own context but as a universal. The stories you&#x2019;re about to read cover, roughly, the span of time from 1968 to 2005. While they&#x2019;re our stories, they&#x2019;re also stories of our times. They cover the arc of what was, what is, and what could be&#x2014;much of it as I&#x2019;ve lived through it or learned directly from those who did, including a great deal of wisdom I found in those older than me. May it be your wisdom now, too.<br><br> Thom Hartmann<br> Washington, DC, May 2011</p><h2>Basic College Mathematics</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Basic Mathematics.</i> </p> <p> </p> <p> <b> <br> </b> </p> <p> <b>Trusted author content.

The goal is to provide illustrations of how modern mathematics is actually employed to solve relevant contemporary problems. Although these independent chapters were prepared primarily for teachers in the general mathematical sciences, they should prove valuable to students, teachers, and research scientists in many of the fields of application as well. Prerequisites for each chapter and suggestions for the teacher are provided. Several of these chapters have been tested in a variety of classroom settings, and all have undergone extensive peer review and revision. Illustrations and exercises are included in most chapters. Some units can be covered in one class, whereas others provide sufficient material for a few weeks of class time. Volume 1 contains 23 chapters and deals with differential equations and, in the last four chapters, problems leading to partial differential equations. Applications are taken from medicine, biology, traffic systems and several other fields. The 14 chapters in Volume 2 are devoted mostly to problems arising in political science, but they also address questions appearing in sociology and ecology. Topics covered include voting systems, weighted voting, proportional representation, coalitional values, and committees. The 14 chapters in Volume 3 emphasize discrete mathematical methods such as those which arise in graph theory, combinatorics, and networks.</p><p></p><h2>Bravo for the Marshallese: Regaining Control in a Post-Nuclear, Post-Colonial World (Case Studies on Contemporary Social Issues)</h2><p>This case study describes the role an applied anthropologist takes to help Marshallese communities understand the impact of radiation exposure on the environment and themselves, and addresses problems stemming from the U.S. nuclear weapons testing program conducted in the Marshall Islands from 1946-1958. The author demonstrates how the U.S. Government limits its responsibilities for dealing with the problems it created in the Marshall Islands. Through archival, life history, and ethnographic research, the author constructs a compelling history of the testing program from a Marshallese perspective. For more than five decades, the Marshallese have experienced the effects of the weapons testing program on their health and their environment. This book amplifies the voice of the Marshallese who share their knowledge about illnesses, premature deaths, and exile from their homelands. The author uses linguistic analysis to show how the Marshallese developed a unique radiation language to discuss problems related to their radiation exposure - problems that never existed before the testing program. Drawing on her own experiences working with the Government of the Marshall Islands, the author emphasizes the role of an applied anthropologist in influencing policy, and empowering community leaders to seek meaningful remedies.</p><p>Holly M. Barker began her work with the Marshallese when she served as a Peace Corps volunteer from 1988 to 1990 on Mili Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI).

Holly has represented the RMI at community, national, bilateral, and international forums, including conferences at the United Nations on such topics such as the extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. She currently resides with her family in Seattle, Washington, and is a full-time lecturer in the Anthropology Department at the University of Washington.</p><h2>Defying Dixie: The Radical Roots of Civil Rights, 1919-1950</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Remarkable . . . an eye-opening book [on] the freedom struggle that changed the South, the nation, and the world.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Washington Post</em></strong></p> The civil rights movement that looms over the 1950s and 1960s was the tip of an iceberg, the legal and political remnant of a broad, raucous, deeply American movement for social justice that flourished from the 1920s through the 1940s. This rich history of that early movement introduces us to a contentious mix of home-grown radicals, labor activists, newspaper editors, black workers, and intellectuals who employed every strategy imaginable to take Dixie down. In a dramatic narrative Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore deftly shows how the movement unfolded against national and global developments, gaining focus and finally arriving at a narrow but effective legal strategy for securing desegregation and political rights.45 illustrations</p><p>Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore is the Peter V. and C. Vann Woodward Professor of History, African American Studies, and American Studies at Yale University. Her research interests include twentieth-century U.S. history; African American history since 1865; U.S. women's and gender history since 1865; history of the American South; and reform movements. Her publications include Norton&#x2019;s Defying Dixie: The Radical Roots of Civil Rights, 1919-1950, which was one of the American Library Association&#x2019;s Notable Books and the Washington Post&#x2019;s Best Books of 2008, and she edited Who Were the Progressives? and co-edited Jumpin&#x2019; Jim Crow: Southern Politics from Civil War to Civil Rights. Her first book, Gender and Jim Crow: Women and the Politics of White Supremacy in North Carolina, 1896-1920, won the Frederick Jackson Turner Award, the James A. Rawley Prize, the Julia Cherry Spruill Prize, and the Heyman Prize.Yale historian Gilmore turns a wide lens on the battle against Jim Crow in this worthy if overstuffed collective biography of the black and white Southern activists whose work before the larger Civil Rights movement constitute its neglected, forgotten or repressed origins. Expanding the temporal and geographical boundaries of the fight for racial equality, Gilmore's scholarship considers international racial politics and traces a progression from 1920s Communists, who joined forces in the late 1930s with a radical left to form a Southern popular front, to the 1940s grassroots activists. Gilmore (<i>Who Were the Progressives?</i>) lavishes attention on the first American-born black Communist, Lovett Fort-Whiteman, who died in a Siberian gulag in 1939; and on FDR-era civil rights activist Pauli Murray, distinguished by her fight against segregation at the University of North Carolina in 1939 and her involvement in the defense of Virginia sharecropper Odell Walker, ultimately executed for killing his white landlord. Gilmore's sweeping, fresh consideration of pre-movement civil rights activity, with its links to both the exportation of American racism and the importation of Communist egalitarianism, is full of informative gems, but the mining is left to the reader. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gray on gray on gray, a forgotten stretch of beach covered in a thick mist, the air heavy with the spray from waves crashing through the loose ice beyond the breakers.<br> <br>A little after 5:00 a.m., the calf opens his eyes.<br> <br>Even though his mother is only a few yards away, splayed out against a makeshift nest of dry reeds that she has gathered from the underbrush deeper toward the center of the island, the calf feels strangely alone. The rest of his herd&#x2014;twenty-five strong, arranged along a matriarchal line that stretches back through three generations&#x2014;has already begun a short pilgrimage down the coast. Being separated from the bulk of the herd feels unnatural. A mild illness has briefly kept his mother from engaging in the routines of survival on the island, so she&#x2019;s stayed behind as the herd has set out to search for more sources of drinkable water and grazing. At less than a year old, the calf has remained with his mother, his familial bonds and youthful needs overcoming his developing social instincts. But neither nature nor nurture makes sitting around waiting for her to get back to her full energy any easier.<br> <br>The calf pushes himself to his feet, the thick muscles in his enormous legs trembling with the effort. His size already makes rising from the ground a bit of an ordeal. He weighed over two hundred pounds at birth and even then stood over three feet tall. Now, though he is far from fully grown, he weighs well over a thousand pounds.<br> <br>He shakes his head back and forth, shedding reeds and bits of snow and ice that gathered over him as he slept. His mother is still lying on her left side against the ground in front of him, her huge body rising and falling as each breath sends clouds of condensation through the frozen air. As big as the calf is, his mother is a veritable mountain, five, maybe six tons, and more than twice his height. It is no wonder that his kind often naps standing up. When they do sleep flat against the ground, it is usually for periods of no more than four to five hours.<br> <br>The calf watches his mother for a few minutes, then kicks the last bits of ice off his legs and starts forward down a gentle, gravelly slope that leads toward the beach.<br> <br>Each heavy step sends tremors up and down his body, as his huge feet compress and churn the frozen ground. The wind howls around him, pushing his tiny, round ears flat against the sides of his head, but he continues forward, his eyes searching the turned permafrost beneath him for bits of grass, moss, roots. As he nears the bottom of the slope, he starts to feel the spray from the waves that crash against the large volcanic rocks making up much of the coast; the water feels good against his body, the glistening, bluish drops beading against the long strands of thick red hair that cover most of his hide.<br> <br>Despite the wind, the icy water, the cold, the calf is not uncomfortable. Though it is a harsh environment, he and his herd are uniquely suited for it; in fact, for thousands of years, Wrangel Island has enabled the huge animals to survive and thrive.<br> <br>Even now, his is one of perhaps two dozen herds on the island. At one time, the super-herd numbered close to a thousand individuals, though in recent years it has dwindled to half that.<br> <br>Though the interrelated herds have always lived in proximity to various predators, it wasn&#x2019;t claws and teeth that cut down the calf&#x2019;s cousins, aunts, and uncles in recent years. The thinning of his kind was part of a natural process of adaptation. The world around him has changed, and his species has adjusted; smaller in number, leaner, but functioning. In this forgotten corner of the world, they have learned, survived.<br> <br>In fact, though the calf couldn&#x2019;t possibly know, the isolated, icy nature of his island home is the only reason the herd still exists at all. A twist of fate, an accident of geography, a turn of weather: Six thousand years earlier, as the world had first begun to warm, the water surrounding Wrangel had risen&#x2014;fifty feet or more&#x2014;and cut off the island from the mainland. The calf&#x2019;s ancestors, who had crossed over one herd at a time along an ice bridge during the colder months of the year, had found themselves trapped. Lost in time.<br> <br>Saved.<br> <br>While the calf&#x2019;s super-herd adapted to its isolation on Wrangel, the rest of their species had died off around the world, over four thousand years ago. The five hundred or so individuals left on the island are all that remain. Split into familial units, close-knit, living in a symbiotic relationship with the island itself, they have lived four thousand years beyond their kind&#x2019;s extinction.<br> <br>The calf finally reaches the bottom of the slope and is now less than a dozen yards from the water itself. The spray is even more palpable now, the frozen droplets pelting his face and hide like hail. It is time to head back up the slope toward his mother. Perhaps she is awake now and well enough to finally rejoin the herd, farther down the coast. He starts to shift his heavy body in the opposite direction, when something out on the water catches his attention.<br> <br>Cutting through the waves, slicing past the jagged chunks of ice and over the breaking foam&#x2014;something the cub has never seen before. He stands frozen in place, staring at the long, cylindrical object, which his mind had no capacity to understand.<br> <br>Like a hollowed-out tree trunk, the object lies horizontal, moving forward on the ocean&#x2019;s surface toward the beach&#x2014;right in his direction.<br> <br>The calf takes a step back, then freezes again. Above the edges of the long object, he can now make out creatures, five or six of them, huddled together against the water&#x2019;s spray. They are small and pale, covered in odd hides that aren&#x2019;t hairy. And they are pointing at him.<br> <br>He watches as one of the creatures rises and lifts a thin wooden shaft tipped in razor-sharp bone high into the air. It is twice as long as the creature itself.<br> <br>The calf stares, too stunned to move. He does not know what these strange creatures are, or why they are heading to his beach. He cannot know that they have come to finish what the millennia of a warming world have not.<br> <br>The calf cannot know that he, his mother, his herd, are the last of his kind.<br> <br>After him, there will be no more.</p><h2>Discrete-Event System Simulation (3rd Edition)</h2><p>This book provides a basic treatment of discrete-event simulation, one of the most widely used operations research and management science tools for dealing with system design in the presence of uncertainty.

Barrow reveals in <i>Nature&#x2019;s Ghosts</i>, the threat of species loss has haunted Americans since the early days of the republic. From Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s day&#x2014;when the fossil remains of such fantastic lost animals as the mastodon and the woolly mammoth were first reconstructed&#x2014;through the pioneering conservation efforts of early naturalists like John James Audubon and John Muir, Barrow shows how Americans came to understand that it was not only <i>possible</i> for entire species to die out, but that humans themselves could be responsible for their extinction. With the destruction of the passenger pigeon and the precipitous decline of the bison, professional scientists and wildlife enthusiasts alike began to understand that even very common species were not safe from the juggernaut of modern, industrial society. That realization spawned public education and legislative campaigns that laid the foundation for the modern environmental movement and the preservation of such iconic creatures as the bald eagle, the California condor, and the whooping crane.</p><p>A sweeping, beautifully illustrated historical narrative that unites the fascinating stories of endangered animals and the dedicated individuals who have studied and struggled to protect them, <i>Nature&#x2019;s Ghosts</i> offers an unprecedented view of what we&#x2019;ve lost&#x2014;and a stark reminder of the hard work of preservation still ahead.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark V.

In this intriguing book, Mark Barrow confronts the paradox of naturalists collecting specimens of imperiled species and striving to be value-free, while becoming intensely concerned about extinction. Barrow shows through a fascinating series of case studies that, despite some contradictions and ironies, the traditions of natural history, ecology, and field biology have been essential to the conservation movement from the late eighteenth century until today. We should be worried, as is Barrow, that the naturalist tradition is fading from our universities, museums, and indeed our entire culture."</p> (Reed F.

Although this may be familiar to some, Barrow's focus on the central role of amateur/professional naturalists sheds much new light on how conservation ideas germinated and flowered in the US. The book focuses largely on animals, with numerous engaging stories, e.g., Thomas Jefferson's obsession with finding live mammoths in the West and a 1935 Cornell University trip that located some of the last ivory-billed woodpeckers in Louisiana. <i>Nature's Ghosts</i> is thoroughly researched with hundreds of helpful references, but remains very accessible and engaging to both casual and professional readers. Numerous black-and-white photos of extinct/endangered species along with famous and lesser-known naturalists enrich the text.

In his day, he was also an inveterate note-taker, penning thousands of intense aphoristic thoughts, observations, and meditations in small pocket pads and school theme books throughout his life. These notebooks, transcribed and presented here in their entirety for the first time, offer unprecedented insight into Frost's complex and often highly contradictory thinking about poetics, politics, education, psychology, science, and religion--his attitude toward Marxism, the New Deal, World War--as well as Yeats, Pound, Santayana, and William James. Covering a period from the late 1890s to early 1960s, the notebooks reveal the full range of the mind of one of America's greatest poets. Their depth and complexity convey the restless and probing quality of his thought, and show how the unruliness of chaotic modernity was always just beneath his appearance of supreme poetic control.</p><p>Edited and annotated by Robert Faggen, the notebooks are cross-referenced to mark thematic connections within these and Frost's other writings, including his poetry, letters, and other prose. This is a major new addition to the canon of Robert Frost's writings.</p></p><p><p>Robert Faggen is Barton Evans and H. Andrea Neves Professor of Literature at Claremont McKenna College.</p>&#x201c;The notebooks bring Frost alive as a person and poet, showing him in the process of thinking through, rethinking, and formulating many of his most important beliefs, ideas, observations, and epigrams. They will generate considerable scholarship both confirming and reevaluating central issues of Frost's life, thinking, and writing. The notebooks are interesting in themselves. They show a remarkable intelligence at work and provide access to the (typically concealed) processes underlying Frost's performances, as well as a catalog of his most important concerns. Also important are Frost's more general observations on human nature and behavior and on social and governmental organization (these often struck me as remarkably prescient of contemporary scientific and philosophical views.) Faggen's book will be crucial to Frost scholars and students. It will moderate, modify, and intensify existing truisms and debates about Frost's person, opinions, and processes, and it will open new areas for consideration.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Guy Rotella, Professor of English, Northeastern University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This work deserves a place with other editions of major writers such as Emerson, Thoreau, and Twain. One measure of the importance of this edition is that it demonstrates that Frost belongs in the company of America's greatest writers, whose significance grows with our access to their complete works. It was a pleasure to read these notebooks.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Timothy Materer, Professor of English, University of Missouri</b><br><br>&#x201c;What modern poet's mental privacy would we rather invade than that of the sly, vexingly evasive Robert Frost? Robert Faggen serves as a reliable guide, conducting us backstage where we are allowed to observe Frost's off-duty pen as it drifts from aphorism to speculation, from opinion and verbal doodling to&#x2015;yes&#x2015;the poetry itself.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Billy Collins</b><br><br>&#x201c;Frost was a deliberate, masterly, and sometimes enigmatic poet, and these qualities show in his notebooks. Faggen offers a beautifully crafted introduction to this superb annotated and cross-referenced volume. The value of this work is tremendous.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony J. Elia</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A new book containing unpublished work by America's most famous poet is a literary event. While he was not much of a diarist, Frost avidly kept notebooks throughout his life. He recorded his daily musings in what Frost scholar Faggen calls '"ordinaries," unassuming dime-store spiral pads and school theme books.' This roughly chronological (the poet abandoned and then resumed writing in some notebooks)<br>and thoroughly annotated edition offers devotees a substantial glimpse of the workings of Frost's complex and often contradictory mind, though it provides little in the way of narrative. In scattered jottings on poetry, teaching, politics and family--to name just a few of the many topics covered--Frost drafts poems ('And oh but it was fetching/ To see the wretches retching'); theorizes about poetics ('The Poem must have as good a point as a [sic] anecdote or joke'); lists topics for later writings ('Subjects used in 1906 Eng classes...Things My Mother Keeps to Remember My Infancy by'); spins aphorisms, stories and sketches; and even shows the development of famous quotes ('No surprise to author none to reader'). Better suited to flipping around in than reading straight through, this is an essential book for Frost fans and serious poetry lovers, who will find it to be a trove of Frost's famously earthy and yet deceptively simple wisdom, as well as a damn good read.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;While those such as Eliot and Stevens shivered with distaste at the idea of writing poetry that was intelligible to the masses, Frost was determined to evolve a style that would appeal both to an average poetry consumer and, through its secret equivocations, to the more discerning reader. Ideally, it would educate the former, and transform them into the latter...In 1915, Frost returned to the US as something of a celebrity, and shrewdly set about cultivating, on the one hand, a popular audience and, on the other, the esteem of influential critics. <i>The Notebooks of Robert Frost</i> offer an intriguing insight into Frost's mind. They are not, it should be said, at all systematic. The first entries in Notebook 4, for instance, were made in 1909, and the last in the 1950s. Some contain drafts of work in progress, others fragments of lectures and notes for classes. Their scrupulous, perhaps over-scrupulous, editor Robert Faggen, has chosen to reprint the contents of all 49 notebooks in their entirety...While only the most devoted of Frost scholars will find their attention held by every page, this is a great book to open at random...Frost once described poetry as a 'momentary stay against confusion.' There's plenty of confusion in these notebooks, but they also offer a series of vivid glimpses into how and why he fashioned each 'momentary stay.'&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark Ford</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Notebooks of Robert Frost</i> [is] seven hundred pages of wisdom and prophecy, raving and rant, expertly edited and annotated by Robert Faggen...The biggest surprise in <i>The Notebooks of Robert Frost</i>, sixty years of private jottings in preparation for poems and prose, is the spectacular profusion of epigrams, aphorisms, and what Frost called 'dark sayings.'&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher Benfey</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The American poet Robert Frost was not keen on having his rough drafts inspected by posterity. Few survive for his poems. Here for the first time, however, are 47 pocket flip-pads, diaries and school exercise books that record his life as a poetic thinker...Frost's notebooks illuminate the oblique concerns of his [poetry].&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeremy Noel-Tod</b><b>, </b><b><i>Daily Telegraph</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Since Frost used his notebooks to think through his poems, his essays and his teaching, they reveal only his working mind--and that's revelation aplenty... By now, nobody buys Frost's old image as a rustic autodidact or a versifying Andy Rooney. He read as widely and deeply as any American poet--the notebooks allude to the likes of Dryden, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Einstein, Santayana and Maria Montessori--and funny as he was, he could still outbleak T. S. Eliot. He was also American poetry's biggest ham (at least until Allen Ginsberg), and his poems were performances: not just in his well-known public readings but on the page. These deliberately preserved notebooks, too, might have kept one eye on an audience. But unlike the much-revised poems, they sometimes show this least innocent of men taking himself by surprise.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Gates</b><b>, </b><b><i>Newsweek</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Frost was as innovative as many poets more often considered 'experimental'...He's a technician of prodigious agility, yet he generally limited himself to iambics, and favored rhymes like 'reason' and 'season' or 'star' and 'far'...Unlike almost every poet of comparable ability, Frost can claim a general reading audience, especially among readers who want poems that 'make sense'--yet his aesthetic is evasive, arguably manipulative, and has at its core a freezing indifference that would make the neighborhood barbecue awfully uncomfortable...Any Frost reader will benefit from Faggen's thoughtful introduction and be intrigued by the way in which concepts from these largely aphoristic journals animate the poems and vice versa...More than four decades after his death, this most American of American poets still fits uncomfortably into our country's favorite aesthetic categories.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Orr</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><h2>Fatigue of Materials (Cambridge Solid State Science Series)</h2><p>Written by one of the most widely quoted researchers in the field, this book is the first to provide an authoritative, comprehensive, and unified treatment of the mechanics and micromechanisms of fatigue in metals, nonmetals, and composites.</p><p>Written by a leading researcher in the field, this revised and updated second edition of a highly successful book provides an authoritative, comprehensive and unified treatment of the mechanics and micromechanisms of fatigue in metals, non-metals and composites.

This reader challenges that assumption and its distinguished contributors demonstrate that technology is affected at a fundamental level by the social context in which it develops. General arguments are introduced about the relation of technology to society and different types of technology are examined: the technology of production; domestic and reproductive technology; and military technology.<p> The book draws on authors from Karl Marx to Cynthia Cockburn to show that production technology is shaped by social relations in the workplace. It moves on to the technologies of the household and biological reproduction, which are topics that male-dominated social science has tended to ignore or trivialise - though these are actually of crucial significance where powerful shaping factors are at work, normally unnoticed. The final section asks what shapes the most frightening technology of all - the technology of weaponry, especially nuclear weapons.</p><p> The editors argue that social scientists have devoted disproportionate attention to the effects of technology on society, and tended to ignore the more fundamental question of what shapes technology in the first place. They have drawn both on established work in the history and sociology of technology and on newer feminist perspectives to show just how important and fruitful it is to try to answer that deeper question. The first edition of this reader, published in 1985, had a considerable influence on thinking about the relationship between technology and society. This second edition has been thoroughly revised and expanded to take into account new research and the emergence of new theoretical perspectives.</p></p><p>Donald MacKenzie holds a personal Chair in Sociology at Edinburgh University, where he has taught since 1975.

Standing in the shadow of the Holocaust, this episode of European history is often overlooked. Wesley Adamczyk's gripping memoir, <i>When God Looked the Other Way</i>, now gives voice to the hundreds of thousands of victims of Soviet barbarism.<br> <br> Adamczyk was a young Polish boy when he was deported with his mother and siblings from their comfortable home in Luck to Soviet Siberia in May of 1940. His father, a Polish Army officer, was taken prisoner by the Red Army and eventually became one of the victims of the Katyn massacre, in which tens of thousands of Polish officers were slain at the hands of the Soviet secret police. The family's separation and deportation in 1940 marked the beginning of a ten-year odyssey in which the family endured fierce living conditions, meager food rations, chronic displacement, and rampant disease, first in the Soviet Union and then in Iran, where Adamczyk's mother succumbed to exhaustion after mounting a harrowing escape from the Soviets. Wandering from country to country and living in refugee camps and the homes of strangers, Adamczyk struggled to survive and maintain his dignity amid the horrors of war.<br> <br> <i>When God Looked the Other Way</i> is a memoir of a boyhood lived in unspeakable circumstances, a book that not only illuminates one of the darkest periods of European history but also traces the loss of innocence and the fight against despair that took root in one young boy. It is also a book that offers a stark picture of the unforgiving nature of Communism and its champions. Unflinching and poignant, W<i>hen God Looked the Other Way</i> will stand as a testament to the trials of a family during wartime and an intimate chronicle of episodes yet to receive their historical due.<br> <br> </p><p>&#x201c;Adamczyk recounts the story of his own wartime childhood with exemplary precision and immense emotional sensitivity, presenting the ordeal of one family with the clarity and insight of a skilled novelist. . . .

Adamczyk's language is earthy, intense, and moving. In addition to the strong portraits of his family, Adamczyk fills the book with unforgettable characters from their odyssey--brutal Red Army soldiers; desperately impoverished yet generous Kazakhs; and the clean, well-dressed Americans.

(Arnold Beichman <i>Washington Times</i> 2004-07-04)<br><br>"Most people are not aware that the Soviet Union annexed the eastern half of Poland in September 1939. Even fewer know that until June 1941, as many as 500,000 Polish "enemies of the state" were deported to the U.S.S.R. As the son of a Polish officer and an educated mother, Wesley Adamczyk was the perfect candidate for deportation. . . . <i>When God Looked the Other Way</i> is fascinating, upsetting, and full of small shocks; and Mr. Adamczyk writes heartfelt, straight-forward prose. . . . This book sheds light on more than one forgotten episode of history." (Gordon Haber <i>New York Sun</i> 2004-07-21)<br><br>"As I finished this book. . . I came to think that it is perhaps a good thing that it was not written and published during the height of the Cold War. At that point, the narrator's black-and-white moral judgments might simply have been dismissed by many readers as counterpropaganda, and his story and that of his family would have probably been ignored. Now, after the demise of the Soviet Union, when we are no longer trying to prove that our way of life is superior, we can better appreciate the awful privations that the Soviet system created for its citizens and for those unlucky enough to have been caught up in it. Adamczyk's unpretentious prose is well-suited to capture that truly awful reality. . . . Perhaps Adamczyk's narrative can help us remember what it is about our country that has traditionally inspired the admiration of the world, and to turn away from the worst elements of hate-mongering and fear that have transformed us into a country more like Adamczyk's USSR than we would like to be."<br><br> (Andrew Wachtel <i>Chicago Tribune</i> 2004-08-15)<br><br><p>"fascinating"</p><p></p> (Piotr Wrobel <i>The Gazette (Montreal)</i> 2004-10-30)<br><br>"Adamczyk is a master story teller.

By encouraging us to argue together, he may yet help us to reason together."&#x2015;Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</strong></p> Higher education <em>should</em> by a battleground of ideas: the real problem, Gerald Graff says, is that students are not getting more out of the battle. In this lively book, Graff argues that the "culture wars" now being fought over multiculturalism and political correctness are actually a sign of the intellectual vitality of American education&#x2015;but they need to be used creatively, made part of the educational process itself.<br></p><p>Gerald Graff, a professor of English and education at the University of Illinois at Chicago and 2008 president of the Modern Language Association of America, has had a major impact on teachers through such books as Professing Literature: An Institutional History, Beyond the Culture Wars: How Teaching the Conflicts Can Revitalize American Education, and Clueless in Academe: How Schooling Obscures the Life of the Mind.Decrying conservatives who claim higher education offers a choice between culture and barbarism, University of Chicago English professor Graff argues eloquently for a curriculum that includes political debates and multicultural texts. Though he brushes away charges of left-wing McCarthyism too easily, he skewers critic Dinesh D'Souza's claim that dead white males are being expelled firom required courses. Graff suggests that conservatives' only strategy to deal with conflicting views is to deny their legitimacy, and he wisely notes that the term common culture is always evolving. Using evidence from his own teaching, Graff shows how incorporating literary criticism written by the African novelist Chinua Achebe helped revise his teaching of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. He suggests that the ideological conflicts that accompany the curricular problem are getting students to grapple with ideas. Observing that students often have teachers with conflicting beliefs and assumptions in different classes, Graff concludes by surveying current innovative attempts at curriculum integration; oddly, he doesn't mention his own university's Great Books program. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Probability and Computing: Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis</h2><p>Assuming only an elementary background in discrete mathematics, this textbook is an excellent introduction to the probabilistic techniques and paradigms used in the development of probabilistic algorithms and analyses.

This book, &#34;a sensitive and revealing contribution to the legend of a unique sisterhood&#34; (Chicago Tribune), tells of three women who each gave her mature life to the love, study, and defense of another primate species.</p><p>Sy Montgomery is an author, naturalist, newspaper columnist, documentary scriptwriter, and radio commentator who writes for children as well as adults. Among her award-winning books are The Snake Scientist and The Man-Eating Tigers of Sundarbans. She made four expeditions to Peru and Brazil to study the pink dolphins of the Amazon. She lives in New Hampshire.<p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong></em><br><br>In this study of three great female primatologists, science journalist Montgomery moves beyond biography into ethology, taking a step that goes well beyond even her subjects' research. Goodall, Fossey and Galdikas each made a similar leap, the author contends, moving from observers and recorders to an almost shamanistic quest to enter the world of the apes they studied. These personal transformations are sketchily supported with anecdotes from the field, personal interviews and even a jarring account of an attempt to contact Fossey, after her death, via channeling. Montgomery adds little to Farley Mowat's 1988 biography of Fossey, Woman in the Mists , but she offers a few fresh angles on Goodall, Galdikas and other characters, human and ape, met before in their books. In an epilogue, Montgomery offers the intriguing view of these scientists as pioneers of a particularly female way of scientific knowing that deserves fuller argument than three portraits allow.

Author Montgomery brings an admirable grace and kindness to her treatment of the three women's lives and work, affording them, in many ways, the same dignity and respect they offered to the animals they observed and card for so deeply....

Not only has this prophecy failed to come true, but today Kula is expanding beyond these island communities to the mainland and Australia.This book unveils the many deep motivations and meanings that lie behind the pursuit of Kula. Focusing upon the visually stimulating carved and painted prow boards that decorate canoes used by the Kula voyagers, Campbell argues that these designs comprise layers of encoded meaning. The unique colour associations and other formal elements speak to Vakutans about key emotional issues within their everyday and spiritual lives. How is mens participation in the Kula linked to their desire to achieve immortality? How do the messages conveyed by the canoe boards converge with those presented in Kula myths and rituals? In what ways do these systems of meaning reveal a male ideology that competes with the prevailing female ideology? Providing an alternative way of understanding the significance of Kula in the Trobriand Islands, The Art of Kula makes an influential new contribution to the ethnography of Papua New Guinea.</p><p>Shirley F.

Inclusion, she argues, begins not with the assumption that students have to earn their way into the classroom with their behavior or skills, it begins with the right of every child to be in the mainstream of education, perhaps with modifications, adaptations, and support. Full inclusion requires teachers to think about all aspects of their classrooms&#x2014;pedagogy, curriculum, and classroom climate.<br><br>Crucially, Sapon-Shevin takes on arguments against full inclusion in a section of straight-talking answers to common questions. She agrees with critics that the rhetoric of inclusion has been used to justify eliminating services and "dumping" students with significant educational needs unceremoniously back into the mainstream with little or no support. If full inclusion is properly implemented, however, she argues, it not only clearly benefits those traditionally excluded but enhances the educations and lives of those considered mainstream in myriad ways.<br><br>Through powerful storytelling and argument, Sapon-Shevin lays out the moral and educational case for not separating kids on the basis of difference.</p><p><b>Mara Sapon-Shevin</b> is a professor of inclusive education at Syracuse University. She the author of several published works, including <i>Because We Can Change the World</i>, <i>Educational Courage: Resisting the Ambush of Public Education, Widening the Circle: The Power of Inclusive Classrooms</i>, and <i>Condition Critical: Key Principles for Equitable and Inclusive Education</i>."<i>Widening the Circle</i> is an ambitious, impassioned argument for inclusive schools powered by a vision that goes far beyond the mutilated version of 'mainstreaming&#x2019; common in American schools today. To Sapon-Shevin the current state of affairs is a caricature of inclusive education, reductive and impoverished, a place where every student is defined by a putative deficit, imprisoned in a label. Her goal&#x2014;breathtaking in its sweep&#x2014;is to break through the walls of the prison, and to set us all free. She shows us that huge questions of democracy and freedom can be discovered in a simple game of musical chairs, that our deepest values are enacted in our everyday classroom practice. A dazzling manifesto and call to arms."&#x2014;William Ayers, author of <i>Teaching toward Freedom</i> and <i>To Teach</i><br><br>"<i>Widening the Circle</i> is packed with sharply observed challenges to conventional ways of thinking. It digs beneath classroom strategies to find larger truths about difference, exposing the moral implications of segregation in the process. One by one, Sapon-Shevin skewers the philosophical and practical objections to inclusion. Her book should be read by all educators, not just those in the field of special education."&#x2014;Alfie Kohn, author of <i>The Schools Our Children Deserve</i> and <i>What Does It Mean to Be Well Educated?</i><br><br>"I love the spirit that infuses the book and the constant reference to the connection between school values and larger democratic values, as well as its attention to the nitty-gritty of classroom life.

Bringing together a wide range of important work in a single, accessible volume, <i>The Witchcraft Reader</i> is ideal for students and general readers intrigued by this complex and fascinating subject.</p></p><p>Darren Oldridge is Lecturer in History at University College Worcester.<strong>'A library of the subject in miniature, affording helpful insights and convenient material for students at all levels.'</strong>&nbsp;&#x2013; <em>Ronald Hutton</em></p><h2>Weavers of Revolution: The Yarur Workers and Chile&#39;s Road to Socialism</h2><p>Weavers of Revolution is a major reinterpretation of the Salvador Allende era in Chile as well as a compelling drama of human triumph and tragedy that exemplifies "the new narrative history" at its authentic best.<br><br>Unfolding a vivid story as seen through the eyes of the participants themselves, the book focuses on the workers at the Yarur factory, Chile's largest cotton mill. After Allende took office in 1970, the workers seized control of the mill and proceeded to socialize its operations. They were to learn, however, that Allende's plans for transforming the country were less radical and more gradualist than theirs, and suddenly they found themselves on a collsion course with the government. Winn, who interviewed the workers and Allende while many of the events were taking place, brilliantly captures the turning point of Chile's "democratic road to socialism" of 1970-73 in both the Yarur mill and the presidential palace, showing how a revolution was forged "from below." As he demonstrates, the confrontation between Allende and the workers and its ultimate outcome reveal an array of complexities in the revolutionary process that too often elude American understanding and frustrate U.S. foreign policy.<br><br>Skillfully integrating oral history with penetrating analysis, this book uncovers the dynamic relationship between leaders and the people they propose to lead, and offers a striking new explanation of how revolutions are radicalized.<br><br>About the Author:<br><br>Peter Winn has taught at Yale and Princeton and is now Associate Professor of History at Tufts University, a Senior Fellow at Columbia University's Research Institute on International Change, and Barnette-Miller Professor of International Relations at Wellesley College.

When the bones of two severed hands are discovered in a box, an investigation into a long buried crime of passion begins. And a group of friends, who played together as children, begin to question their past. &#39;For Woody, anger was cold. Cold and slow. But once it had started it mounted gradually and he could think of nothing else. He knew he couldn&#39;t stay alive while those two were alive. Instead of sleeping, he lay awake in the dark and saw those hands. Anita&#39;s narrow white hand with the long nails painted pastel pink, the man&#39;s brown hand equally shapely, the fingers slightly splayed.&#39; Beneath the green meadows of Loughton, Essex, a dark network of tunnels has been dug. A group of children discover them. They play there. It becomes their place. Seventy years on, the world has changed. Developers have altered the rural landscape. Friends from a half-remembered world have married, died, grown sick, moved - or disappeared. Work on a new house called Warlock uncovers a long buried grisly secret. And a weary detective, more concerned with current crimes, must investigate a case of murder. In all her novels, Ruth Rendell digs deep beneath the surface to investigate the secrets of the human psyche. The interconnecting tunnels of Loughton in The Girl Next Door lead to no single destination. But the relationships formed there, and the incidents that occurred, exert a profound influence - not only on the survivors but in unearthing the true nature of the mysterious past.</p><p>Ruth Rendell was an exceptional crime writer, and will be remembered as a legend in her own lifetime. Her groundbreaking debut novel, From Doon With Death, was first published in 1964 and introduced the reader to her enduring and popular detective, Inspector Reginald Wexford, who went on to feature in twenty-four of her subsequent novels. With worldwide sales of approximately 20 million copies, Rendell was a regular Sunday Times bestseller. Her sixty bestselling novels include police procedurals, some of which have been successfully adapted for TV, stand-alone psychological mysteries, and a third strand of crime novels under the pseudonym Barbara Vine. Very much abreast of her times, the Wexford books in particular often engaged with social or political issues close to her heart. Rendell won numerous awards, including the Crime Writers&#39; Association Gold Dagger for 1976&#39;s best crime novel with A Demon in My View, a Gold Dagger award for Live Flesh in 1986, and the Sunday Times Literary Award in 1990. In 2013 she was awarded the Crime Writers&#39; Association Cartier Diamond Dagger for sustained excellence in crime writing. In 1996 she was awarded the CBE and in 1997 became a Life Peer. Ruth Rendell died in May 2015. Her final novel, Dark Corners, is scheduled for publication in October 2015&#34;The Girl Next Door is vintage Rendell and a perfect celebration of her half-century. She&#39;s so effortlessly prolific that it&#39;s easy to take her for granted; we assume that if we miss one of her books, there&#39;ll be another one along in a minute. This novel, however, reminded me of the singularity of Ruth Rendell&#39;s talent, her effortless mastery of language and her uncanny genius for mapping a criminal mind.&#34; * The Times * &#34;Rendell is as masterful as ever; her writing tense, brittle, and brilliant.&#34; * Sunday Mirror * &#34;She is the peer of Kingsley Amis and Muriel Spark. The Girl Next Door is as great a novel as Stanley and the Women or Memento Mori . . . a joy to read. Rendell&#39;s novels establish a sense of order that is deeply satisfying.&#34; * Evening Standard * &#34;Fifty years on, the girl from Essex has become the unchallenged crime queen of suburbia. Her powers of observation are as acute as ever, and she writes about old age with as much gusto as any of the subjects she has tackled in her long career.&#34; * Sunday Times * &#34;This book is extraordinarily courageous, a demonstration that fiction can take us where reportage dares not go.&#34; * Independent * &#34;Rendell gives an acutely observed portrayal of old age through her characters&#39; regrets, losses and bewilderment . . . Difficult themes such as death, usually dressed up in mystery in a crime novel are, thanks to these elderly protagonists, real, hard-hitting and constant.&#34; * Observer * &#34;That The Girl Next Door works as a standalone novel is partly attributable to Rendell&#39;s deftness in parrying comparisons with her best-known creation. It also unravels a satisfying mystery, stretching tentacles into the past.&#34; * Spectator * &#34;An excellent analysis of re-found youth, this novel shows how people can surprise themselves even in their winter years.&#34; * Sunday Express * &#34;In this engaging novel, the portraits of elderly people living today and their preoccupations are presented with almost sociological precision, and scattered throughout are acute observations about changing language and manners.&#34; * Literary Review * &#34;Nobody does the suburbs like Ruth Rendell: in her expert hands they exert a morbid fascination. Behind the immaculate exteriors lurks a world of unhappiness and deceit - and at times murder. An excellent read.&#34; * The Lady *</p><h2>God and Harry Potter at Yale: Teaching Faith and Fantasy Fiction in an Ivy League Classroom</h2><p>Who would have believed it?

He had apprenticed in joinery, the most common method of making furniture in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Britain, and he became Ipswich's second joiner, setting up shop in the heart of the village. During his lifetime, Dennis won wide renown as an artisan. Today, connoisseurs judge his elaborately carved furniture as among the best produced in seventeenth-century America.</p><p>Robert Tarule, historian and accomplished craftsman, brilliantly recreates Dennis's world in recounting how he created a single oak chest. Writing as a woodworker himself, Tarule vividly portrays Dennis walking through the woods looking for the right trees; sawing and splitting the wood on site; and working in his shop on the chest&#x2015;planing, joining, and carving. Dennis inherited a knowledge of wood and woodworking that dated back centuries before he was born, and Tarule traces this tradition from Old World to New. He also depicts the natural and social landscape in which Dennis operated, from the sights, sounds, and smells of colonial Ipswich and its surrounding countryside to the laws that governed his use of trees and his network of personal and professional relationships.</p><p>Thomas Dennis embodies a world that had begun to disappear even during his lifetime, one that today may seem unimaginably distant.

While they must decide how best to provide for him, he ends up making a crucial choice of his own.</p><p>Born in New York City, Will Eisner (1917&#x2013;2005) was the author of the legendary comic strip The Spirit, as well as fifteen graphic novels and three influential instructional textbooks. The comic industry&#x2019;s top awards, the Eisner Awards, are named in his honor.Eisner, who created the masked crime-fighter the Spirit in 1940, is one of the few early comic-books veterans still active and certainly the only one turning out new work more ambitious than the genre tales for which he is best known. Eisner now mostly creates graphic novels depicting Jewish life in America. In the latest, family members prepare to observe their patriarch's ninetieth birthday as he sits silent and paralyzed after a stroke. Eisner portrays the clan's ambitions, pretensions, and disappointments broadly. At the gathering, as long-standing resentments surface, family members face deciding how to provide for the old man, and he makes a crucial choice of his own. <i>Family Matter</i> lacks the scale of some of Eisner's newer work and features bluntly one-dimensional characters. But its depiction of how families are held together by a force "that sometimes seems to be neither love nor loyalty" rings true. Moreover, Eisner's drawing here, less slick and dramatic than that of his prime, has an agreeable looseness that helps convey the story movingly. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Foundations of Real Estate Financial Modelling</h2><p><p><em>Foundations of Real Estate Financial Modelling</em> is specifically designed to provide an overview of pro forma modelling for real estate projects.

All of these pieces have been arranged to resemble, as much as possible, the existing piano accompaniments. These ensembles enable a cello teacher (who does not play or have access to a piano) to play harmony parts with students to prepare them for the time when a piano and pianist are available. These parts also provide additional challenges for the more advanced player during a group lesson.

Rabbinic Judaism, however, largely avoided discussion of holy war in the Talmud and related literatures for the simple reason that it became dangerous and self-destructive. Reuven Firestone's <em>Holy War in Judaism </em>is the first book to consider how the concept of ''holy war'' disappeared from Jewish thought for almost 2000 years, only to reemerge with renewed vigor in modern times.<br><br>The revival of the holy war idea occurred with the rise of Zionism. As the necessity of organized Jewish engagement in military actions developed, Orthodox Jews faced a dilemma. There was great need for all to engage in combat for the survival of the infant state of Israel, but the Talmudic rabbis had virtually eliminated divine authorization for Jews to fight in Jewish armies. Once the notion of divinely sanctioned warring was revived, it became available to Jews who considered that the historical context justified more aggressive forms of warring. <br><br>Among some Jews, divinely authorized war became associated not only with defense but also with a renewed kibbush or conquest, a term that became central to the discourse regarding war and peace and the lands conquered by the state of Israel in 1967. By the early 1980's, the rhetoric of holy war had entered the general political discourse of modern Israel. In <em>Holy War in Judaism</em>, Firestone identifies, analyzes, and explains the historical, conceptual, and intellectual processes that revived holy war ideas in modern Judaism.<br></p><p><br><strong>Reuven Firestone</strong> is Professor of Medieval Judaism and Islam at the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion, Los Angeles.<br><br>"<em>Holy War in Judaism</em> has serious implications for the Arab-Israeli conflict whose peaceful solution, as Firestone stresses in the end, can only be reached when radicalism ceases on both, the Israeli and Arab sides." --<em>Middle East Media and Book Reviews</em><p></p><br>"In Firestone's hands, holy war in Judaism moves quickly from a self-acknowledged questionable premise to a well-documented ancient historical reality,arabbinic theoretical possibility, and now once again an operative category and a modern-day paradigm for military action. His thoughtful assessments and painstaking research are matched by an easy-to-read style that makes the book suitable for nonexperts, and students of history, sociology, and religion can all benefit from its detailed discussions." --<em>Journal of Church and State</em><p></p><br>"Admirers of Reuven Firestone will not be disappointed with this book, and its intriguing title and subtitle accurately outline its main thesis...This is in every way an excellent book, detailed and accurate and well-argued throughout...The book is certainly now the standard text on the topic and I am sure will remain so for a very long time. A sign of its excellence is that it raises many issues which it does not settle, and readers will find it a stimulating and inspiring read. --<em>Ilahiyat Studies</em><p></p><br>"Reuven Firestone's comprehensive and deeply researched study of Jewish ideas of holy war could not be more timely. Modern Jewish sovereignty has caused some Jews to reject the rabbinic restrictions on 'commanded war' and to portray the struggles of the state of Israel in messianic terms. The tradition that Firestone has unearthed and reconstructed is now very much at stake in the most contemporary debates over Israel's future."--David Biale, Emanuel Ringelblum Distinguished Professor of Jewish History Chair in the Department of History, University of California at Davis<p></p><br>"Reuven Firestone has given us a first-rate history of the origins, transformations, and renewed relevance of the idea of divinely-justified war in Judaism. Firestone's narrative is crystal clear, and his selection, presentation, and interpretation of the primary sources reveal him to be a master of his topic. This is a worthy companion to the author's earlier volume on <em>jihad</em> in Islamic thought."--Martin S. Jaffee, Samuel and Althea Stroum Chair in Jewish Studies, University of Washington<p></p><br>"Simultaenously interesting and valuable as a study of both the historical conceptualization of normative rabbinic thought on war and its reconceptualization and application in contemporary Israel... Firestone takes readers inside the religious debate that is also going on, places it in the moral frame that nourishes it, and helps readers to understand not only the nature of that frame but the internal tensions that define it." --<em>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</em><p></p><br>"Reuven Firestone's clear and comprehensive account of the career of the idea of holy war in Judaism is a most welcome contribution. This book will push readers to think about concepts-for example, 'holy' war as fighting considered legitimate in virtue of its authorization by God-as well as about the ways human communities develop ideas about war in response to concrete social and political conditions. Firestone's study deserves extensive discussion from a wide audience."--John Kelsay, Bristol Distinguished Professor of Religion and Ethics, Florida State University<p></p><br>"<em>Holy War in Judaism</em> is written in a very clear and explanatory style and is therefore also suitable for non-expert readers with an interest in Judaism, Israel, peace and violence, and holy war. Students and scholars of political and social sciences, history, and religious studies will benefit most from its detailed discussion of Jewish religious thinking on divinely sanctioned military action."--<em>LSE Review of Books</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Joan Lunden&#39;s a Bend in the Road Is Not the End of the Road: 10 Positive Principles For Dealing With Change</h2><p>With millions of Americans watching, one of the nation's most popular television personalities, Joan Lunden, made a life-altering transition with grace and ease as she brought to a close two decades of hosting <em>Good Morning America.</em> For the first time Joan candidly reveals how she approached such an enormous challenge as an opportunity for growth -- and how you can, too.<p>For each change that occurred during the course of those twenty years, Joan had an entire nation watching her respond, commenting on the things that she did, critiquing the way that she did them, and putting forth opinions on what she should do next: "People I had never met constantly offered me suggestions about how I should handle my divorce, how I should raise my children, and the career choices I should make after GMA. I was a private citizen with the normal stresses that a mother, wife, and businesswoman endures on a daily basis, going through life's changes in a public arena."</p><p>We all go through change. Whether it's an illness in the family, a divorce, teenagers acting out, losing a job, having to move, or kids leaving the nest, one thing is certain: Change is the only thing we can count on. Yet, while change is the one constant in our lives, it often produces the greatest amount of fear. In this inspiring new book, Joan shows us the importance of staying levelheaded in the face of crisis no matter what or whom you're facing.</p><p>Both an intimate self-portrait and a practical blueprint for living a happier, more fulfilling life, <em>A Bend in the Road is Not the End of the Road</em> proves once again why so many viewers have followed Joan Lunden for so many years.</p><p></p></p><p>We can't stop changes from occurring, but we can control how we react to them, says Joan Lunden, cohost of <i>Good Morning America</i> for 20 years, who suddenly found herself ending her stint on the show and unsure of her future. She shares her story and her philosophy that change--as negative as it may seem at the time--is an opportunity to grow. The book teaches that "staying even is better than getting even." <p> If you're a fan of Joan Lunden, this book is like listening to her tell her stories for hours. Amidst tidbits of philosophy, Lunden offers flashbacks to memorable incidents on and off the show, such as her first interview with Howard Stern, ice-skating in Central Park with Brian Boitano, training for a Las Vegas dance production, and smashing her alarm clock on David Letterman's show. </p><p> "Whether it's a breakup, a job change, or a loss of your health or a loved one, you need to learn to change what you can, accept what you can't," says Lunden. Lunden shares the tools that work for her, such as reorganization, relaxation, pampering, hobbies, reflection, exercise, and positive affirmations. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><p>Joan Lunden was the co-host of <em>Good Morning America</em> for nearly two decades, bringing insight to the day's top stories, from presidential elections to health and wellness. Her bestselling books include <em>Joan Lunden's Healthy Cooking</em>, <em>Joan Lunden's Healthy Living</em>, <em>Wake-Up Calls</em>, and <em>A Bend in the Road Is Not the End of the Road</em>. Joan speaks all over the country about health and wellness, inspiration, and success.

As a&nbsp;classicist, Christian Jacob brings a fresh eye to his subject&#x2014;which includes maps from Greek Antiquity to the twentieth century&#x2014;and provides a theoretical approach to investigating the power of maps to inform, persuade, and inspire the imagination. <br><br>Beginning with a historical overview of maps and their creation&#x2014;from those traced in the dirt by primitive hands to the monumental Dutch atlases and ornate maps on Italian palace walls&#x2014;Jacob goes on to consider the visual components of cartography: the decorative periphery, geometric grid, topographical lines, dots, details of iconographic figures, and many other aspects. Considering text on maps&#x2014;titles, toponyms, legends, and keys&#x2014;Jacob proposes that writing can both clarify and interfere with a map's visual presentation. Finally Jacob examines the role of the viewer in decoding a map's meaning and the role of society in defining the power of maps as authoritative depictions of space. <br><br>Innovative in its philosophical motivation and its interdisciplinary approach to looking at and writing about maps, <i>The Sovereign Map</i> is eagerly awaited by scholars from many different fields.</p><p><b>Christian Jacob</b> is directeur de recherche at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique in Paris. <b>Edward H.

(Susan Schulten <i>Isis</i>)<br><br>"Cartography plays a central role in knowledge integration in the twenty-first century, and this book provides a valuable historical building block for research on this important topic. . . . <i>The Sovereign Map</i> remains one of the most important contributions to an understanding of maps and mapping in recent years and should be required reading for all cartographers." (D.R. Fraser Taylor <i>Cartographia</i>)<br><br>"The author and his translators have considerably expanded our ability to discuss what maps do and how they change." (Bruce Fetter <i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i>)<br><br>"This is a wonderful book. I think it shows through a careful historical reading how cartography has not been a mad project to achieve the unachievable; rather it has always been both the product and the driver of the thinking in particular places and times where each map was made." (Danny Dorling <i>H-Net Book Review</i>)<br><br>"This is a profound and important book. . . . In no way should it be seen as a history of cartography; it is rather a prolonged reflection on the philosophy of the map, how it is viewed by creator and user, how it achieves its purposes, how it communicates at every level of meaning, deliberately or unconsciously, how it displays or hides the various messages that it conveys." (P.D.A. Harvey <i>IMCoS Journal</i>)<br><br>"The range of this volume remains extraordinary. . . . This gives Jacob an extraordinarily generous space for exploration.

In this eloquently written, scientifically rigorous and well documented book, chapters on William Petty, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, William Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, L�on Walras, Alfred Marshall, John Maynard Keynes, Joseph Schumpeter and Piero Sraffa alternate with chapters on other important figures and on debates of the period. Economic thought is seen as developing between two opposite poles: a subjective one, based on the ideas of scarcity and utility, and an objective one based on the notions of physical costs and surplus. Professor Roncaglia focuses on the different views of the economy and society and on their evolution over time and critically evaluates the foundations of the scarcity-utility approach in comparison with the Classical/Keynesian approach.</p><p>Eloquently written and scientifically rigorous, this well documented 2005 book traces the history of economic thought from antiquity to the present day.

Together these artists and their many associates accented peculiarities of Englishness through the links and affinities they forged with earlier generations of the island's marginals and outsiders, such as playwright Joe Orton, writers like the decadent Count Eric Stenbock, ecstatic mystic novelist Arthur Machen and occult figures like Austin Osman Spare and Aleister Crowley.</p><p>While functioning as an obsessively researched biography of the three interrelated groups, David Keenan's book also works to trace their influences, explicating a reverse current that runs counter to the mainstream, drawing upon occult strains of transgressive performance, queer sensuality, and richly textured sound worlds.</p><p>This much-anticipated expanded edition of a book first published in 2002 and long out of print comes completely redesigned, with color throughout, with many new and previously unseen photographs and ephemera, including two new chapters: a final summary of how the &#x201c;Reverse&#x201d; has shifted gear since the book was first published, and a new essay, &#x201c;Crime Calls For Night.&#x201d;</p></p><p>David Keenan is an author and critic based in Glasgow, Scotland.

This revision reflects the expertise of APRNs from throughout the field who serve in a variety of settings and the expertise of interdisciplinary team members. The goal of the curriculum is to provide a foundation of knowledge from which APRNs can practice palliative care. In the last decade, the evidence base for palliative care has expanded. The chapters in this curriculum reflect this. To meet the rapidly changing needs of the APRN, the Core Curriculum has been reorganized. The first section, Issues in Palliative Nursing, presents an overview of the role and practice concerns. The second section, Dimensions of Care, reviews common symptoms, and psycho-social-spiritual aspects of care. The third section, Management of Common Serious or Life-Threatening Illnesses, describes pathophysiologies and disease specific management. New in this edition are sections devoted on vulnerable and special populations, and an expanded appendix to include a pharmacological quick reference, a review of oxygen therapy, and other useful references.</p><p></p><h2>Difference and Repetition (Impacts)</h2><p><p>Since its publication in 1968, "Difference and Repetition", an exposition of the critique of identity, has come to be considered a contemporary classic in philosophy and one of Deleuze's most important works. The text follows the development of two central concepts, those of pure difference and complex repetition. It shows how the two concepts are related, difference implying divergence and decentring, repetition being associated with displacement and disguising. The work moves deftly between Hegel, Kierkegaard, Freud, Althusser and Nietzsche to establish a fundamental critique of Western metaphysics, and has been a central text in initiating the shift in French thought - away from Hegel and Marx, towards Nietzsche and Freud.</p></p><p>Difference and Repetition, a brilliant exposition of the critique of identity, has come to be considered a contemporary classic in philosophy and one of Deleuze&#39;s most original works.Gilles Deleuze was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII.</p><h2>The Gilded Age: A Tale of To-Day, Volume 2</h2><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

In his person and in his pursuits he was a man of extraordinary contrasts. Although he left school at twelve when his father died, he was eventually awarded honorary degrees from Yale University, the University of Missouri, and Oxford University. His career encompassed such varied occupations as printer, Mississippi riverboat pilot, journalist, travel writer, and publisher. He made fortunes from his writing but toward the end of his life he had to resort to lecture tours to pay his debts. He was hot-tempered, profane, and sentimental<b></b>and also pessimistic, cynical, and tortured by self-doubt. His nostalgia helped produce some of his best books. He lives in American letters as a great artist, the writer whom William Dean Howells called the Lincoln of our literature.Chapter 1 Nibiwa win o-dibendan aki.1<br><br> Eng. A gallant tract<br><br> Of land it is!<br><br> Meercraft. &#x2019;Twill yield a pound an acre:<br><br> We must let cheap ever at first. But, sir,<br><br> This looks too large for you, I see.<br><br> June, 18&#x2014;. Squire Hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks, called the &#x201c;stile,&#x201d; in front of his house, contemplating the morning.<br><br> The locality was Obedstown, East Tennessee. You would not know that Obedstown stood on the top of a mountain, for there was nothing about the landscape to indicate it&#x2014;but it did: a mountain that stretched abroad over whole counties, and rose very gradually. The district was called the &#x201c;Knobs of East Tennessee,&#x201d; and had a reputation like Nazareth,2 as far as turning out any good thing was concerned.<br><br> The Squire&#x2019;s house was a double log cabin, in a state of decay; two or three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold, and lifted their heads sadly whenever Mrs. Hawkins or the children stepped in and out over their bodies. Rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard; a bench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of water and a gourd; a cat had begun to drink from the pail, but the exertion was overtaxing her energies, and she had stopped to rest. There was an ash-hopper by the fence, and an iron pot, for soft-soap-boiling, near it.<br><br> This dwelling constituted one-fifteenth of Obedstown; the other fourteen houses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the corn-fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the city and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on his eyes for information.<br><br> &#x201c;Squire&#x201d; Hawkins got his title from being postmaster of Obedstown&#x2014;not that the title properly belonged to the office, but because in those regions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort, and so the usual courtesy had been extended to Hawkins. The mail was monthly, and sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single delivery. Even a rush like this did not fill up the postmaster&#x2019;s whole month, though, and therefore he &#x201c;kept store&#x201d; in the intervals.<br><br> The Squire was contemplating the morning. It was balmy and tranquil, the vagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers, the murmur of bees was in the air, there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that summer woodlands bring to the senses, and the vague, pleasurable melancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire.<br><br> Presently the United States mail arrived, on horseback. There was but one letter, and it was for the postmaster. The long-legged youth who carried the mail tarried an hour to talk, for there was no hurry; and in a little while the male population of the village had assembled to help. As a general thing, they were dressed in homespun &#x201c;jeans,&#x201d; blue or yellow&#x2014;there were no other varieties of it; all wore one suspender and sometimes two&#x2014;yarn ones knitted at home,&#x2014;some wore vests, but few wore coats. Such coats and vests as did appear, however, were rather picturesque than otherwise, for they were made of tolerably fanciful patterns of calico&#x2014;a fashion which prevails there to this day among those of the community who have tastes above the common level and are able to afford style. Every individual arrived with his hands in his pockets; a hand came out occasionally for a purpose, but it always went back again after service; and if it was the head that was served, just the cant that the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted under, was retained until the next call altered the inclination; many hats were present, but none were erect and no two were canted just alike. We are speaking impartially of men, youths and boys. And we are also speaking of these three estates when we say that every individual was either chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises, or smoking the same in a corn-cob pipe. Few of the men wore whiskers; none wore moustaches; some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and hiding the throat&#x2014;the only pattern recognized there as being the correct thing in whiskers; but no part of any individual&#x2019;s face had seen a razor for a week.<br><br> These neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier reflectively while he talked; but fatigue soon began to show itself, and one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the fence, hump-shouldered and grave, like a company of buzzards assembled for supper and listening for the death-rattle. Old Damrell said:<br><br> &#x201c;Tha hain&#x2019;t no news &#x2019;bout the jedge, hit ain&#x2019;t likely?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Cain&#x2019;t tell for sartin; some thinks he&#x2019;s gwyne to be &#x2019;long toreckly, and some thinks &#x2019;e hain&#x2019;t. Russ Mosely he tole ole Hanks he mought git to Obeds tomorrer or nex&#x2019; day he reckoned.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I wisht I knowed. I got a prime sow and pigs in the cote-house,3 and I hain&#x2019;t got no place for to put &#x2019;em. If the jedge is a gwyne to hold cote, I got to roust &#x2019;em out, I reckon. But tomorrer&#x2019;ll do, I &#x2019;spect.&#x201d;<br><br> The speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stem-end of a tomato and shot a bumble-bee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet away. One after another the several chewers expressed a charge of tobacco juice and delivered it at the deceased with steady aim and faultless accuracy.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a stirrin&#x2019;, down &#x2019;bout the Forks?&#x201d; continued Old Damrell.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I dunno, skasely. Ole Drake Higgins he&#x2019;s ben down to Shelby las&#x2019; week. Tuck his crap down; couldn&#x2019;t git shet o&#x2019; the most uv it; hit warn&#x2019;t no time for to sell, he say, so he fotch it back agin, &#x2019;lowin&#x2019; to wait tell fall. Talks &#x2019;bout goin&#x2019; to Mozouri&#x2014;lots uv &#x2019;ems talkin&#x2019; that-away down thar, Ole Higgins say. Cain&#x2019;t make a livin&#x2019; here no mo&#x2019;, sich times as these. Si Higgins he&#x2019;s ben over to Kaintuck n&#x2019; married a high-toned gal thar, outen the fust families, an&#x2019; he&#x2019;s come back to the Forks with jist a hell&#x2019;s-mint o&#x2019; whoop-jamboree notions, folks says. He&#x2019;s tuck an&#x2019; fixed up the ole house like they does in Kaintuck, he say, an&#x2019; tha&#x2019;s ben folks come cler from Turpentine for to see it. He&#x2019;s tuck an&#x2019; gawmed it all over on the inside with plarsterin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s plarsterin&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I dono. Hit&#x2019;s what he calls it. Ole Mam Higgins, she tole me. She say she warn&#x2019;t gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog. Says it&#x2019;s mud, or some sich kind o&#x2019; nastness that sticks on n&#x2019; kivers up everything. Plarsterin&#x2019;, Si calls it.&#x201d;<br><br> This marvel was discussed at considerable length; and almost with animation. But presently there was a dog-fight over in the neighborhood of the blacksmith shop, and the visitors slid off their perch like so many turtles and strode to the battle-field with an interest bordering on eagerness. The Squire remained, and read his letter. Then he sighed, and sat long in meditation. At intervals he said:<br><br> &#x201c;Missouri. Missouri. Well, well, well, everything is so uncertain.&#x201d;<br><br> At last he said:<br><br> &#x201c;I believe I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x2014;A man will just rot, here. My house, my yard, everything around me, in fact, shows that I am becoming one of these cattle&#x2014;and I used to be thrifty in other times.&#x201d;<br><br> He was not more than thirty-five, but he had a worn look that made him seem older. He left the stile, entered that part of his house which was the store, traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of beeswax to an old dame in linsey-woolsey,4 put his letter away, and went into the kitchen. His wife was there, constructing some dried apple pies; a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weather-vane of his own contriving; his small sister, close upon four years of age, was sopping corn-bread in some gravy left in the bottom of a frying-pan and trying hard not to sop over a finger-mark that divided the pan through the middle&#x2014;for the other side belonged to the brother, whose musings made him forget his stomach for the moment; a negro woman was busy cooking, at a vast fire-place. Shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the place.<br><br> &#x201c;Nancy, I&#x2019;ve made up my mind. The world is done with me, and perhaps I ought to be done with it. But no matter&#x2014;I can wait. I am going to Missouri. I won&#x2019;t stay in this dead country and decay with it. I&#x2019;ve had it on my mind some time. I&#x2019;m going to sell out here for whatever I can get, and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and start.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Anywhere that suits you, suits me, Si. And the children can&#x2019;t be any worse off in Missouri than they are here, I reckon.&#x201d;<br><br> Motioning his wife to a private conference in their own room, Hawkins said: &#x201c;No, they&#x2019;ll be better off. I&#x2019;ve looked out for them, Nancy,&#x201d; and his face lighted. &#x201c;Do you see these papers? Well, they are evidence that I have taken up Seventy-five Thousand Acres of Land in this county&#x2014;think what an enormous fortune it will be some day! Why, Nancy, enormous don&#x2019;t express it&#x2014;the word&#x2019;s too tame! I tell you, Nancy&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For goodness sake, Si&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wait, Nancy, wait&#x2014;let me finish&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve been secretly boiling and fuming with this grand inspiration for weeks, and I must talk or I&#x2019;ll burst! I haven&#x2019;t whispered to a soul&#x2014;not a word&#x2014;have had my countenance under lock and key, for fear it might drop something that would tell even these animals here how to discern the gold mine that&#x2019;s glaring under their noses. Now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it in the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly&#x2014;five or ten dollars&#x2014;the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an acre now, but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars, fifty dollars, a hundred dollars an acre! What should you say to&#x201d; [here he dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see that there were no eavesdroppers,] &#x201c;a thousand dollars an acre!<br><br> &#x201c;Well you may open your eyes and stare! But it&#x2019;s so. You and I may not see the day, but they&#x2019;ll see it. Mind I tell you, they&#x2019;ll see it. Nancy, you&#x2019;ve heard of steamboats, and may be you believed in them&#x2014;of course you did. You&#x2019;ve heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies and humbugs,&#x2014;but they&#x2019;re not lies and humbugs, they&#x2019;re a reality and they&#x2019;re going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now. They&#x2019;re going to make a revolution in this world&#x2019;s affairs that will make men dizzy to contemplate. I&#x2019;ve been watching&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve been watching while some people slept, and I know what&#x2019;s coming.<br><br> &#x201c;Even you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that little Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours&#x2014;and in high water they&#x2019;ll come right to it! And this is not all, Nancy&#x2014;it isn&#x2019;t even half! There&#x2019;s a bigger wonder&#x2014;the railroad! These worms here have never even heard of it&#x2014;and when they do they&#x2019;ll not believe in it. But it&#x2019;s another fact. Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an hour&#x2014;heavens and earth, think of that, Nancy! Twenty miles an hour. It makes a man&#x2019;s brain whirl. Some day, when you and I are in our graves, there&#x2019;ll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles&#x2014;all the way down from the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans&#x2014;and its got to run within thirty miles of this land&#x2014;may be even touch a corner of it. Well, do you know, they&#x2019;ve quit burning wood in some places in the Eastern States? And what do you suppose they burn? Coal!&#x201d; [He bent over and whispered again:] &#x201c;There&#x2019;s whole worlds of it on this land! You know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?&#x2014;well, that&#x2019;s it. You&#x2019;ve taken it for rocks; so has every body here; and they&#x2019;ve built little dams and such things with it. One man was going to build a chimney out of it. Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet! Why, it might have caught fire and told everything. I showed him it was too crumbly. Then he was going to build it of copper ore&#x2014;splendid yellow forty-per-cent. ore! There&#x2019;s fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore on our land! It scared me to death, the idea of this fool starting a smelting furnace in his house without knowing it, and getting his dull eyes opened. And then he was going to build it of iron ore! There&#x2019;s mountains of iron ore here, Nancy&#x2014;whole mountains of it. I wouldn&#x2019;t take any chances. I just stuck by him&#x2014;I haunted him&#x2014;I never let him alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the chimneys in this dismal country. Pine forests, wheat land, corn land, iron, copper, coal&#x2014;wait till the railroads come, and the steamboats! We&#x2019;ll never see the day, Nancy&#x2014;never in the world&#x2014;never, never, never, child. We&#x2019;ve got to drag along, drag along, and eat crusts in toil and poverty, all hopeless and forlorn&#x2014;but they&#x2019;ll ride in coaches, Nancy! They&#x2019;ll live like the princes of the earth; they&#x2019;ll be courted and worshiped; their names will be known from ocean to ocean! Ah, well-a-day! Will they ever come back here, on the railroad and the steamboat, and say &#x2018;This one little spot shall not be touched&#x2014;this hovel shall be sacred&#x2014;for here our father and our mother suffered for us, thought for us, laid the foundations of our future as solid as the hills!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You are a great, good, noble soul, Si Hawkins, and I am an honored woman to be the wife of such a man&#x201d;&#x2014;and the tears stood in her eyes when she said it. &#x201c;We will go to Missouri. You are out of your place, here, among these groping dumb creatures. We will find a higher place, where you can walk with your own kind, and be understood when you speak&#x2014;not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue. I would go anywhere, anywhere in the wide world with you. I would rather my body should starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in this lonely land.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Spoken like yourself, my child! But we&#x2019;ll not starve, Nancy. Far from it. I have a letter from Eschol Sellers&#x2014;just came this day. A letter that&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll read you a line from it!&#x201d;<br><br> He flew out of the room. A shadow blurred the sunlight in Nancy&#x2019;s face&#x2014;there was uneasiness in it, and disappointment. A procession of disturbing thoughts began to troop through her mind.

These fourteen essays cover the entire range of his work on these subjects, in chronological order beginning with his first published analysis of a work of literature, the 1907 "Delusion and Dreams in Jensen's <i>Gradiva</i>" and concluding with the 1940 posthumous publication of "Medusa's Head." Many of the essays included in this collection have been crucial in contemporary literary and art criticism and theory.<br>Among the subjects Freud engages are Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet, The Merchant of Venice, King Lear,</i> and <i>Macbeth,</i> Goethe's <i>Dichtung und Wahrheit,</i> Michelangelo's <i>Moses,</i> E. T. A. Hoffman's "The Sand Man," Dostoevsky's <i>The Brothers Karamazov,</i> fairy tales, the effect of and the meaning of beauty, mythology, and the games of aestheticization. All texts are drawn from <i>The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</i>, edited by James Strachey. The volume includes the notes prepared for that edition by the editor.<br>In addition to the writings on Jensen's <i>Gradiva</i> and Medusa, the essays are: "Psychopathic Characters on the Stage," "The Antithetical Meaning of Primal Words," "The Occurrence in Dreams of Material from Fairy Tales," "The Theme of the Three Caskets," "The <i>Moses</i> of Michelangelo," "Some Character Types Met with in Psycho-analytic Work," "On Transience," "A Mythological Parallel to a Visual Obsession," "A Childhood Recollection from <i>Dichtung und Wahrheit,"</i> "The Uncanny," "Dostoevsky and Parricide," and "The Goethe Prize."</p><p>&#x201c;These are classic essays, referred to over and over again in work of all sorts, widely read, and extensively used in courses.

Focusing on women's engagement with &#x1e25;ad&#x12b;th, this book analyzes dramatic chronological patterns in women's &#x1e25;ad&#x12b;th participation in terms of developments in Muslim social, intellectual, and legal history. Drawing on primary and secondary sources, this work uncovers the historical forces that shaped Muslim women's public participation in religious learning. In the process, it challenges two opposing views: that Muslim women have been historically marginalized in religious education, and alternately that they have been consistently empowered thanks to early role models such as '&#x100;'isha bint Ab&#x12b; Bakr, the wife of the Prophet Mu&#x1e25;ammad. This book is a must-read for those interested in the history of Muslim women as well as in debates about their rights in the modern world. The intersections of this history with topics in Muslim education, the development of Sunn&#x12b; orthodoxies, Islamic law, and &#x1e25;ad&#x12b;th studies make this work an important contribution to Muslim social and intellectual history of the early and classical eras.</p><p>Asma Sayeed's book traces the history of Muslim women's religious education over the course of nearly ten centuries. It focuses on women's transmission of religious knowledge (specifically of reports attributed to the Prophet Mu&#x1e25;ammad) and examines the reasons for the rise, decline, and reappearance of women in this arena. It also relates these trends to broader issues facing Muslim communities in these eras. This fascinating history is relevant for anyone interested in the history of Muslim women as well as those seeking a fuller understanding of developments in Muslim educational and social history, such as the development of Sunn&#x12b; Muslim orthodoxy, the evolution of the scholarly classes (ulam&#x101;), and the social history of &#x1e25;ad&#x12b;th transmission.Asma Sayeed is Assistant Professor of Islamic Studies in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Los Angeles.

World-renowned biomechanics expert Vladimir Zatsiorsky has written <i>Kinetics of Human Motion</i> to be an indispensable reference for human movement professionals. </p><p>Although biomechanical analysis of human motion can be conducted on different structural levels, this book focuses on the examination of forces that create entire body motion. By examining the forces that create entire body motion, the text develops the biomechanical knowledge of the reader. <i>Kinetics of Human Motion</i> is divided into six chapters that cover external contact forces, statics, kinematic chains, inertial characteristics of the body, dynamics of human motion and work, and energy in human motion. Readers will learn about the following:</p><p>Three-dimensional analysis of forces and movements<br>- Kinetics of multilink chains<br>- Stability of equilibrium<br>- Inertial properties of the human body<br>- Joint torques and forces<br>- Inverse problem of dynamics</p><p>This text is advanced and assumes some knowledge of algebra and calculus, yet the emphasis is clearly on understanding physical concepts, not mathematical formulae. The book features helpful refreshers of basic mathematical concepts and kinesiology and other movement-related topics to facilitate reader comprehension of the topics presented.</p><p><i>Kinetics of Human Motion</i> is packed with illustrations and equations to help clarify and reemphasize the main concepts; it also contains review problems, applied research problems, end-of-chapter questions, and references throughout. For a more rounded understanding of the concepts, each chapter includes &#x201c;From the Literature&#x201d; elements, which support the theories discussed while offering other viewpoints. </p><p>This is the second book in a three-book series that will cover the entire range of biomechanics of human motion. <i>Kinematics of Human Motion</i> was the first book; this book, <i>Kinetics of Human Motion</i>, covers the analysis of entire body motion; the muscle biomechanics will be covered in the third volume of the series. </p><p></p></p><p><p> <br><b>Vladimir M.

The subsequent police investigation was bungled, leading to a six-decade cover-up, ensuring that this twenty-one-year-old fashion designer was effectively killed twice: first bodily, and then as her significance and her memory were erased. Fred Vermorel's forensic, troubling (and trouble-making) investigation digs deep into Jean Townsend's life and times, and her transgressive bohemian milieu. It disentangles the lies and bluffs that have obscured this puzzling case for over half a century and offers a compelling solution to her murder and the official secrecy surrounding it. </p><p>More than just a true crime story, Vermorel's investigation deploys Townsend's death as a wild card methodology for probing the 1950s: a cesspit of vice and violence, from coprophiles to bombsite gangs and flick knives in the cinema. Densely illustrated with archival material, <i>Dead Fashion Girl </i>is a heavily researched, darkly curious expos� of London's 1950s society that touches on celebrity, royalty, the postwar establishment, and ultimately, tragedy.</p></p><p>Fred Vermorel is a pioneer of the in-depth study of celebrity and fan cultures, best known for his controversial &#34;anti-biographies&#34; of pop icons including the Sex Pistols, Kate Bush, Vivienne Westwood, and Kate Moss.</p><h2>Greek Sculpture: An Exploration, Vol. 2: Plates</h2><p>This is an account of large-scale Greek sculpture from the Dark Ages to Augustus (c.1200-30 BC). Andrew Stewart not only describes and dates the sculpture but also places it in its full social and political context. He focuses on who the sculptors were, how their workshops were run, who commissioned and supported their work, and what the political, cultural, and natural settings were. The book consists of two volumes, Text and Plates, and contains more than 900 high quality illustrations and reconstructions. Also included are a glossary of Greek and Latin terms, and translations of ancient literary and epigraphical testimonies.</p><p>Originally begun as a successor to Gisella Richter's Sculpture and Sculptors of the Greeks (Oxford Univ.

The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli</h2><p>Elsa Schiaparelli (1890-1973) was the premier style arbiter of the 1930s - a favorite designer of women who made the best-dressed list, of female sports heroes, and of film and theater actresses. This book is the first comprehensive look at the work of this startling and innovative Paris fashion designer.</p><p>If you're a fashionista who's not a babe, you look for clothes that create attention all by themselves. That was the secret of Elsa Schiaparelli, the Italian designer who gave women unusual textures, eccentric patterns and surprising shapes influenced by the Surrealist artists in her circle. In <i>Shocking! The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli</i>--a winking reference to her most famous perfume as well as to her designing audacity--Dilys E. Blum celebrates the couturiere whose achievements have long been eclipsed by her rival, Coco Chanel. A frustrated sculptor, Schiaparelli invested many of her garments of the 1930s and '40s with an architectural quality, from aerodynamic, back-swept bustles and overskirts dramatically curved back over themselves to stiff, fan-shaped peplums. She created a hat in the shape of an upside-down shoe, made comfy leopard-skin booties, and incorporated such novelties as monkey fur and Rhodophane, a transparent man-made fabric. Her clothes were worn by Mae West and heiress Millicent Rogers, by Helena Rubenstein and French film star Arletty. At her most eccentric, inspired by the artist Man Ray, Schiaparelli produced suede gloves with red snakeskin fingernails. At her most practical, she designed a daring (in 1931) silk tennis costume with a divided skirt. More than 300 stunning photographs, both vintage and contemporary, and a detailed yet lively text made this book a must for anyone interested in the history of fashion. A coordinated exhibition of the same title is at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, through Jan. 4, 2004, before traveling to Paris. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>Dilys E.

Recognizing that city environments and the planning processes that shape them are powerful determinants of population health, urban planners today are beginning to take on the added challenge of revitalizing neglected urban neighborhoods in ways that improve health and promote greater equity. In <i>Toward the Healthy City</i>, Jason Corburn argues that city planning must return to its roots in public health and social justice. The first book to provide a detailed account of how city planning and public health practices can reconnect to address health disparities, <i>Toward the Healthy City</i> offers a new decision-making framework called &#x201c;healthy city planning&#x201d; that reframes traditional planning and development issues and offers a new scientific evidence base for participatory action, coalition building, and ongoing monitoring. </p><p>To show healthy city planning in action, Corburn examines collaborations between government agencies and community coalitions in the San Francisco Bay area, including efforts to link environmental justice, residents' chronic illnesses, housing and real estate development projects, and planning processes with public health. Initiatives like these, Corburn points out, go well beyond recent attempts by urban planners to promote public health by changing the design of cities to encourage physical activity. Corburn argues for a broader conception of healthy urban governance that addresses the root causes of health inequities. </p></p><p>Jason Corburn is Associate Professor of City &amp; Regional Planning in the College of Environmental Design at UC Berkeley. He is the author of <i>Street Science: Community Knowledge and Environmental Health Justice</i>, winner of the 2007 Paul Davidoff award given by the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning."Corburn's<br><br>"A wonderfully readable, incisive analysis of the common ground between planning and public health. "Toward the Healthy City" reminds us that both environmental and social determinants of health must be considered, and that physical, political, and institutional changes must all be on the agenda, if we are to achieve healthy cities for all, especially for the most vulnerable among us."--Howard Frumkin, Director, National Center for Environmental Health/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<br><br>"Jason Corburn is the torch bearer of the youngest generation of US advocates for integrated and empowered approaches to urban health planning, following in the footsteps of UC Berkeley luminaries such as Leonard Duhl and Sir Peter Hall. No surprise, then, that Corburn has produced a compelling call for action for US cities to move toward healthy cities. The time and political climate are ripe for such a step change in US urban development. Corburn inspires by continuing the argument he convincingly made in Street Science: good urban governance with empowered communities will lead to the re-emergence of synergies between the new public health, street-level urban planning, and a politics of community development that enable all to achieve their best; health, wealth, and the fulfilment of dreams and aspirations. Don't just read this book. Act on it."--Evelyne de Leeuw, Chair, Community Health Systems and Policy, Deakin University<br><br>"Corburn's "Toward the Healthy City" shows us how to reunite urban planning and public health. This is the great partnership that was responsible for major advances in health in the early 20th century. As Corburn reveals, by recreating this partnership we can overcome health disparities, chronic disease, and other pressing health problems of our era. This book is a must for everyone interested in health, cities, planning and our planet's future."--Mindy Thompson Fullilove, Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and Sociomedical Sciences, Columbia University<br><br>"Jason Corburn's incisive book provides a critical exploration of the necessary link between the role of city planning and public health in setting the long-term conditions for health and health equity in urban America. Combining historical, political, and social analysis, this long overdue assessment makes an important contribution to the theory and practice of achieving health equity that will be useful for planners, public health practitioners, and activists struggling for social justice."--Richard Hofrichter, Senior Analyst, Health Equity, National Association of County &amp; City Health Officials</p><h2>English / Spanish Glossary for Anatomy and Physiology (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>English/Spanish Glossary for Anatomy and Physiology (Spanish Edition)</p><p></p><h2>The Saint Mary&#39;s Press Essential Bible Concordance: NRSV Catholic Edition</h2><p>Help young people go deeper in their Scripture studies with this simple, abridged concordance/index to key words in the Bible.

Completely revised and updated to comply with UML notation, this book gives techniques for serial, concurrent, and synchronized processing specification.</p><p>This book presents those concepts and techniques that support almost any system development approach--whether it involves computers, people, or machines. It considers object structure, object behavior and more advanced concepts such as composition, structural constraints, rules, using rules and diagrams, meta-modeling, and power types. Shows how to represent OOA constructs--modeling object structure, modeling object behavior, modeling state transitions and event diagrams, scenarios. Outlines considerations for design, discusses object-oriented programming, and considers object-oriented design and &#34;instant&#34; CASE.PREFACE<br><br> What if there were a standard set of core concepts for object-oriented analysis and design (OO A&amp;D)? What if there were a prescribed set of diagrams for communicating these concepts? Imagine how much simpler our OO A&amp;D world would be&#x2014;not to mention the world of OO-CASE vendors. We could all speak a common OO A&amp;D language, rather than some dialect based on a particular methodologist or OO-CASE vendor. I'm not sure such an event would ever meet everyone's satisfaction. Furthermore, I'm not sure that one fixed set of diagrams can (or should) express everything we need to say. But, a way to express most of our A&amp;D knowledge is now available. With the OMG's Object Analysis and Design Taskforce (OA&amp;DTF) a standard now exists for:<br> a common meta-model for maintaining our OO A&amp;D knowledge,<br> a technique for exchanging this knowledge, and<br> a notation for expressing our OO A&amp;D knowledge.<br>A Little History<br><br> Grady Booch was the first to organize an OO A&amp;D standardization effort. In the spring of 1993, he asked a handful of major methodologists if they wished to create an OO A&amp;D standard. (Jim Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, Stephen Mellor, Peter Coad, and I were included.) However, assembling these people for even one day proved too daunting as we could only agree on a short breakfast meeting at OOPSLA �93 in Washington, DC. Since the idea of standardization was considered undesirable by the majority at the meeting, the standards movement floundered&#x2014;but not for long.<br><br> In October 1994, Rational Software Corporation succeeded in hiring Jim Rumbaugh. With the combined force of Booch and Rumbaugh, Rational decided to produce its own standard approach, then called the Unified Method. Its rollout occurred at OOPSLA '95 in Austin accompanied by singing (Jim) and merriment (Grady). When Ivar Jacobson joined Rational about a year later, the resulting unified approach became stronger and broader. Soon, Rational's approach&#x2014;now called the UML (Unified Modeling Language)&#x2014;became a unification of more than Booch, Rumbaugh, and Jacobson. Literally dozens of other methodologists and organizations became part of an effort known as the UML Partners.<br>Enter the OA&amp;D Task Force<br><br> By 1995, OO A&amp;D unification and standardization were certainly in the wind and on June 29, 1995, an old special interest group was revived within the OMG (thanks to Richard Soley and Ivar Jacobson). This renewed special interest group became known as the Object Analysis and Design Task Force (OA&amp;DTF) and was co-chaired by Mary Loomis and me. Its bimonthly meetings are usually attended by 30 to 90 individuals representing dozens of companies. After an initial period of data gathering and discussion in 1995, the OA&amp;DTF submitted its first Request for Proposal (RFP) in June 1996. All submissions to this RFP were required to:<br> define a meta-model that represented the semantics of object analysis and design models.<br> define the OMG's IDL (Interface Definition Language) interfaces that enable models or model elements created by one tool to be accessed from another tool. The model access facility had to be either an import facility or a connection facility or both.<br> provide a set of notations for representing models.<br> include a "proof of concept" statement, explaining how the submitted specifications have been demonstrated to be technically viable.<br> accommodate evolution of models and incorporation of additional semantics over time.<br>Who responded to the RFP?<br><br> Those organizations that responded include: Hewlett-Packard, I-Logix, ICON Computing, IntelliCorp, IBM, MCI Systemhouse, Microsoft, ObjecTime Limited, Oracle, Platinum Technology, PTech, Rational Software Corporation, Reich Technologies, Softeam SA, Taskon A/S, Sterling Software (formerly Texas Instruments Software), and Unisys. On January 17, 1997, these companies coordinated their responses, resulting in six submissions. In the months that followed, the effort was unified into a single proposal. On September 1, 1997, all 18 organizations presented the UML proposal to the OMG.<br>Conclusion<br><br> In summary, the OA&amp;D facility is expected to implement the interfaces that would enable tool builders to provide facilities for tool users to:<br> extend and augment a model produced by another conforming tool.<br> use a model produced by another conforming tool in the course of producing a different but related model.<br> Additionally, this RFP resulted in a standard notation for users to express their models.<br> A few years ago, such a facility was hoped for and dreamed about&#x2014;but hardly considered feasible. Now, there is a standard defining the core concepts for OO analysis and design and a prescribed set of diagrams for communicating these concepts.<br><br> While this standard will not solve all our problems, it will reduce the Babel-ization surrounding OO A&amp;D communications. Furthermore, it will provide a kind of Rosetta Stone for communicating various kinds of OO A&amp;D specifications. We can then put more effort into what we're communicating&#x2014;and not so much into how we communicate it. Imagine a world where an OO developer can spend less time in religious battles about notation and more time on the quality of communication.<br>This book was revised in this spirit.<br><br> James J. Odell</p><h2>Pebbles to Computers: The Thread</h2><p>Using an exciting synthesis of text and pictures, photographer Hans Blohm and scientist Stafford Beers present a graphic exploration of the connections between prehistoric and antique technologies and those of our modern world. In this inventive book, a Byzantine sun-dial and a modern satellite signal receiver are among the many images that have been chosen to show the 'thread' connecting our efforts down the ages to use and record information.<br> The story of computation emerges as the central theme. By tracing its development from the earliest use of pebbles through the abacus, the slide rule and finally to the most sophisticated modern circuits, the authors present a convincing argument that 'high tech' does indeed go back to the dawn of time. Blohm and Beers have travelled from Stonehenge to the Pyramid of the Sun in Mexico, marvelled over Leonardo's inventions in Milan and examined Leibniz's calculator in Hanover in their search for evidence of the patterns of human invention. They isolate some critical issues in the development of technology, such as the reproduction of written language, and cover many of the outstanding names: Archimedes, Caxton, Pascal, Babbage and Turing among others. With an introduction by renowned zoologist David Suzuki, <em>Pebbles to Computers</em> is a remarkable testament to the depth and richness of humanity's technological achievements.</p><p><br><em>About the authors:</em><br> <strong>Hans Blohm</strong> works around the world as a photographer in the forefront of scientific camera-work. <strong>Stafford Beer</strong>, a Canadian scientist, philosopher, and poet, was a pioneer of cybernetics and is an international authority on the science of organizations. <strong>David T. Suzuki</strong>, geneticist and zoologist, is famous for his PBS series "The Nature of Things."<br>This intriguing book is both beautiful and thought-provoking. Generally, it deals with humanity's attempt to organize and analyze its experience; more specifically, it traces the history of efforts at computation. From the Athenians' use of pebbles to cast ballots, to Stonehenge, to Jacquard and his "automated" control of the loom, to Babbage, Eniac, and beyond, the book features striking photography and perceptive yet concise text. Suzuki, a geneticist known to the public for CBS TV series including The Nature of Things , provides a fine introduction to the photographs by science photographer Blohm and text by cybernetics theorist Beer.

Though many of the gastronomic pioneers gathered here are less well known, their diverse influence on American dining should not be overlooked&#x2014;plus, their stories are truly entertaining. We meet an African American oyster dealer who became the Congressional caterer, and, thus, a powerful broker of political patronage; a French chef who was a culinary savant of vegetables and drove the rise of California cuisine in the 1870s; and a rotund Philadelphia confectioner who prevailed in a culinary contest with a rival in New York by staging what many believed to be the greatest American meal of the nineteenth century.

He then presents a concise and wide-ranging history of colonization in Africa, from the era of construction through consolidation and decolonization. Young argues that several qualities combined to make the European colonial experience in Africa distinctive. The high number of nations competing for power around the continent and the necessity to achieve effective occupation swiftly yet make the colonies self-financing drove colonial powers toward policies of "ruthless extractive action." The persistent, virulent racism that established a distance between rulers and subjects was especially central to African colonial history.<br><br>Young concludes by turning his sights to other regions of the once-colonized world, comparing the fates of former African colonies to their counterparts elsewhere. In tracing both the overarching traits and variations in African colonial states, he makes a strong case that colonialism has played a critical role in shaping the fate of this troubled continent.<br></p><p>In this comprehensive and original study, a distinguished scholar of African affairs argues that the crisis in African development can be traced directly to European colonial rule, which left the continent with a &#34;singularly difficult legacy&#34;.

Her future husband came from a family of Iraqi Jews who had immigrated to Israel. She was a non-observant Jew from Hollywood whose encounters with Jewish food had been limited to her grandmother&#39;s matzoh ball soup, a semiannual brisket, and an occasional cheese blintz. Twena&#39;s mother-in-law ushered her into a world of flavorful dishes. Captivated, she coaxed out the recipes, which had been passed through generations but never written down. Beginning with her husband&#39;s extended family, she went on to interview members of the Sephardic community (the term for Jews with ancient roots in Spain), persuading them to open their kitchens to her and divulge their coveted recipes. The result is a collection of 175 of Twena&#39;s favorite recipes from Morocco, Libya, Algeria, and Tunisia in North Africa; from the Ottoman communities of Turkey, Rhodes, and Greece; from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, and Iran in the Middle East;</p><p>Sephardic Jews include those who left Spain during the Inquisition in 1492 and the people in Jewish communities where the Babylonian Talmud is followed. These communities, found mainly in the Middle East, tend to be exclusive, insular, and to eat very well.<p> From Morocco and Italy east to Iran and India, Sephardic cooking is a rich blend of herbs and spices, of sweet and savory flavors. Hummus, stuffed grape leaves, and pilafs made with rice or bulgur are a few Sephardic dishes you may recognize.</p><p> Author Pamela Grau Twena's introduction to Sephardic cooking was unexpected. A nonobservant Jew from Hollywood, she met her husband, whose Orthodox family had emigrated from Iraq to Israel, on a blind date. After they married, they lived with his parents in Israel for one challenging year. <i>The Sephardic Table</i> grew, in part, from Twena's efforts to bond with her conservative mother-in-law, who guarded her territory so jealously that it took Twena months just to be allowed in the kitchen.</p><p> Obtaining recipes was difficult, even outside the family, because most Sephardic women cook by habit and feel, not following written instructions. Asked how many eggs she puts in a dish, a woman sputtered, "How can I tell you? It depends on the chickens that day, it depends on the freshness of the flour."</p><p> When she returned to the U.S., Twena continued her research in Sephardic cooking. Her collection of recipes, punctuated with moving personal stories, encompasses Italian Roasted Tomatoes generously seasoned with garlic, Indian Cardamom Chicken braised with six spices, and dishes from Sephardim living in countries everywhere in between. While Twena felt challenged by this ritualized way of cooking, where you are supposed to stir the pot in a particular way and are only allowed combine certain foods, even timid cooks can manage most of the recipes in <i>The Sephardic Table</i>. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>Pamela Grau Tewna spent nearly a year in Isreal, where she learned Sephardic traditions from he Iraqi in-laws. Returning to California, she spent years collectiong Sephardic recipes, successfully self-publishing a book on the subject. She lives in Newport Beach, California.</p><h2>International Trade</h2><p>Providing a modern view today's economy you can relate to, <em>International Trade</em> shares the realities of a global econmomy through real-world situations from relations with Cuba to Europe's refugee crisis, to how NAFTA effects wages and employment and more.</p><p><b>Robert C.

Conversely, in the individual histories of these magazines can be gleaned highlights of literary activity and insights on the writers and editors in the forefront. The literary magazines of the twentieth century, most of them known as littles because of small budgets and circulation and short lives, number in the thousands. Some, like the venerable New Yorker, have enjoyed wide circulation for well over half a century; others, like The Fugitive, published in Nashville, Tennessee, in the early 1920s, were regional and/or experimental and short-lived. Of these thousands, editor Edward E. Chielens has selected seventy-six of the most significant for description and analysis in individual historical essays. An additional one hundred magazines are briefly profiled in an appendix. Forty-three scholars and writers contributed to this volume.</p><p></p><p>Following the pattern established in Chielens's earlier complementary volume, <i>American Literary Magazines: The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries</i>, the magazine essays also provide appended data on information sources and publishing history. The volume introduction discusses the characteristics of different types of literary magazines in the twentieth century and their sponsoring organizations or individuals as well as the influence on their development of leading literary figures such as Ezra Pound and H. L. Mencken. This discussion is bolstered by a chronological appendix to the volume presenting highlights in the history of literary magazines in the perspective of events in literary history. An additional appendix provides a directory of major collections of literary magazines in the United States and Canada with descriptions of their holdings.</p></p><p><p>The history of modern American literature is inextricably tied to the history of the literary magazine.

Japan has played a key role in spurring this transformation.

Alternating scenes between bawdy tavern and regal court, between revelry and politics, Shakespeare probes at the sources, uses, and responsibilities of power as an old king dies and a young king must choose between a ruler's solemn duty and a merry but dissipated friend, Falstaff. The play represents Shakespeare at the peak of his maturity in writing historical drama and comedy.</p><h2>Introducing RDA: A Guide to the Basics (ALA Editions)</h2><p>Resource Description and Access (RDA) is the new cataloguing standard that will replace the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR). The 2010 release of RDA is not the release of a revised standard; it represents a shift in the understanding of the cataloguing process. Author Chris Oliver, Cataloguing and Authorities Coordinator at the McGill University Library and chair of the Canadian Committee on Cataloging, offers practical advice on how to make the transition. This indispensible Special Report helps catalogers by: Concisely explaining RDA and its expected benefits for users and cataloguers, presented through topics and questions, Placing RDA in context by examining its connection with its predecessor, AACR2, as well as looking at RDA&#39;s relationship to internationally accepted principles, standards and models, Detailing how RDA positions us to take advantage of newly emerging database structures, how RDA data enables improved resource discovery, and how we can get metadata out of library silos and make it more accessible, No cataloger or library administrator will want to be without this straightforward guide to the changes ahead.</p><p>Chris Oliver has worked at the McGill University Library since 1989, as a cataloguing librarian and cataloguing manager.

I would strongly recommend buying this book for your library, so that everyone can understand the new changes and standards that will influence how libraries and others will deal with the description and organization of information in the future." - Collection Building "The book provides a basic understanding of how our work will transition once we adopt RDA. There is a good general introduction to RDA... There is an especially good introduction to the use of the RDA Toolkit, including descriptions of Toolkit navigation and explanations of how the Toolkit may be integrated into our work...Introducing RDA could provide an introduction for the uninitiated technical services librarian, for library administrators and for interested public services or systems folks.

UNDERSTANDING CRIME begins with an overview of the key elements of the study of crime and criminology, including law, public policy, research literature, and the philosophical origins of crime theories. These theories, based in biology, psychology, and sociology, are then broken down to their basic elements and causal processes in order to be explored. The authors examine the practical implications and applications each theory has on the administration of justice. In conclusion, the text looks at the future of crime theory by speculating whether or not new research designs, theories, and paradigms are needed. With a new modular format, this text can be customized for any teaching or learning style.</p><p>L. Thomas Winfree, Jr., received his Ph.D. degree (sociology) from the University of Montana in 1976.

This book introduces social skills programs to parents of preschool- and kindergarten-aged children diagnosed with one of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), including Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, and PDD: Not Otherwise Specified. The book is based on the authors' decades of clinical experience using Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), a proven educational method, to teach social skills at home and school. This book focuses on four broad topics: play skills; the language of social skills; understanding another person's perspective; functioning in an inclusive classroom. This book helps parents to work with their child's strengths to improve social skills. Following the suggestions and exercises in this book, parents can teach children to: pretend-play, use toys appropriately, know when to use conventional responses like - excuse me - tell jokes, recognise that others' feelings and thoughts are different from their own, and initiate social interaction with peers. Included are tips for using games, modelling, rewards, role play, videos, activity schedules, and social stories to teach social skills and make the learning experience fun for parents and children. A case study of one family's efforts and successes provides a real-life example that's informative and reassuring. Appendices listing resources such as books, games, and activities give parents additional material to explore. <p> <i>Also by Sandra Harris</i>:<br> <b>Siblings of Children with Autism: A Guide for Families</b><br> <b>Right from the Start: Behavioral Intervention for Young Children with Autism</b><br> <b>Incentives for Change: Motivating People with Autism Spectrum Disorders to Learn and Gain Independence</b><br> <b>Essential First Steps for Parents of Children with Autism</b><br> </p><p> <i>Also by Mary Jane Weiss</i>:<br> <b>Right from the Start: Behavioral Intervention for Young Children with Autism</b><br> <b>Teaching Social Skills to People with Autism: Best Practices in Individualizing Interventions</b><br> <b>Jumpstarting Communication Skills in Children with Autism</b></p></p><p>Sandra L Harris PhD is a Board of Governors Distinguished Service Professor at the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology and the Department of Psychology at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

Challenging the belief that indigenous movements emerge as isolated, politically unified fronts, she shows that Pan-Mayanism reflects diverse local, national, and international influences. She explores the movement's attempts to interweave these varied strands into political programs to promote human and cultural rights for Guatemala's indigenous majority and also examines the movement's many domestic and foreign critics.</p><br><p> The book focuses on the years of Guatemala's peace process (1987--1996). After the previous ten years of national war and state repression, the Maya movement reemerged into public view to press for institutional reform in the schools and courts and for the officialization of a "multicultural, ethnically plural, and multilingual" national culture. In particular, Warren examines a group of well-known Mayanist antiracism activists--among them, Demetrio Cojt!, Mart!n Chacach, Enrique Sam Colop, Victor Montejo, members of Oxlajuuj Keej Maya' Ajtz'iib', and grassroots intellectuals in the community of San Andr s--to show what is at stake for them personally and how they have worked to promote the revitalization of Maya language and culture. Pan-Mayanism's critics question its tactics, see it as threatening their own achievements, or even as dangerously polarizing national society. This book highlights the crucial role that Mayanist intellectuals have come to play in charting paths to multicultural democracy in Guatemala and in creating a new parallel middle class.</p></p><p><b>Kay B.

Hatley retrieves the unfamiliar dimensions of a world in which Native Americans were at the center of Southern geopolitics and in which radically different social assumptions about the obligations of power, the place of women, and the use of the land fed the formative cultural psychology of the colonial South. Weaving together firsthand accounts, journals, and letters to give a human reality to the facts of war, politics, and the economy, he pinpoints the revolutionary decade--from the little known but decisive Cherokee war through the Revolution itself--in which both societies struggled over their own identities. Rather than focusing on the Cherokees and Carolinians separately, this book focuses on contacts, encounters, exchanges, intersections: their mutual history. Hatley argues that Cherokee and colonial histories cannot be understood separately--that they are inextricably linked--and that the origins of distinctive features of Native American and colonial ethnicity and seemingly unrelated twists in the political history of each society are rooted in this encounter.<br></p><p>This book traces the interactions between the Cherokee people and the South Carolina settlers, from the establishment of Charleston in 1680, until the first Cherokee treaty in 1785.Tom Hatley is at Catskill Center for Conservation and Development.</p><h2>The Psychology of Terrorism (Political Violence)</h2><p><p>To understand the psychology of those who engage in terrorism, John Horgan draws on interviews with terrorists and analyzes current evidence to argue that only by asking the right questions about this complex problem, and by answering them with evidence, can we truly begin to understand the nature of terrorism and respond effectively. Consequently this book presents a critical analysis of our existing knowledge and understanding of terrorist psychology, and in doing so, highlights the substantial shortcomings and limitations of the nature and direction of current research. </p> <p>This new volume presents a unique model of involvement and engagement in terrorism by considering it as a process and exploring three distinct phases of the making of a terrorist: becoming involved, remaining involved (or 'being' a terrorist), and leaving terrorism behind. Despite the ongoing search for a terrorist personality, the most insightful and evidence-based research to date not only illustrates the lack of any identifiable psychopathology in terrorists, but demonstrates how frighteningly 'normal' and unremarkable in psychological terms are those who engage in terrorist activity.<br>By producing a clearer picture of the complex processes that impinge upon the individual terrorist, a different type of terrorist psychology emerges, one which has controversial implications for efforts at countering terrorism in today's world.<br>The book concludes with what this new psychology of terrorism means for understanding the terrorist and highlights what both researchers and the broader community can do to realistically engage the terrorist threat. </p></p><p>Professor John Horgan lectures in Psychology at the Department of Applied Psychology, University College Cork.<p><strong>'John Horgan&#x2019;s</strong> <em>The Psychology of Terrorism</em> <strong>is one of the best applications of a social science discipline (in this case, psychology) to explain the drivers that motivate individuals to become terrorists, function as terrorists, and, in ideal cases, disengage from terrorism.

To be Tuscan, Pino says, "is to honor all your senses." And he believes that everyone would benefit from having a little bit of Tuscany in his or her life, which is why he has written <b>Simply Tuscan</b>.<br><br>Welcome in the spring with a menu of quintessentially seasonal recipes, such as Artichoke, Romaine, and Pea Soup, followed by Roasted Veal with Lemon and Sage, and sweetened with Panna Cotta with Strawberries and Balsamic Vinegar. Or welcome your in-laws with a meal they'll never forget: Zucchini Soup with Mint, Ricotta Ravioli with Osso Buco Gremolata, and Upside-Down Warm Apple Tart.<br><br>Follow Pino to the seashore in summer, where, as he says, "the beach makes us wild with energy," to partake of a Summer Night Seafood Extravaganza--Crispy Fried Shrimp with Summer Vegetables in Sweet and Sour Vinaigrette, Trout Roasted Porchetta-Style, and Lobster and Cannellini Beans in Guazzetto.<br><br>Celebrate Thanksgiving Tuscan-style and, Pino promises, it will give you something else to be thankful for. Start the meal with Farro, Swiss Chard, and Butternut Squash Soup. Follow it up with Goose with Vineyard Stuffing instead of the usual turkey. Try Mashed Potatoes with Leeks in place of the candied sweets, and finish with Spiced Poached Pears with Vin Santo Sabayon.<br><br>Winter means comfort food all over the world, and in Tuscany this might mean Oven-Baked Leg of Pork Glazed with Chestnut Honey, a Carrot and Apple Pur�e, and Caramelized Baba Scented with Orange.<br><br>All of these recipes and many more, accompanied by Pino's wise and witty commentary on the occasions for which they were devised, are intended, in his words, to "convert you to Tuscanism...once you get a taste for it, there's no turning back." And this beautifully designed, lavishly illustrated, deliciously tempting book of recipes is certain to do just that.<br>Some of the recipes, such as Cacciucco, a fish and shellfish stew, or the Easter Torta with Cheese, are totally, typically, <br>traditionally Tuscan; others, like Crabmeat Ravioli in Ginger-Scented Vegetable Broth and the Bay Scallop and Asparagus Risotto are modern interpretations, which, nevertheless, remain truly Tuscan in spirit.<br><br>SIMPLY TUSCAN is intended, in Pino's words, to "convert you to Tuscanism--once you get a taste for it, there's no turning back." And this beautifully designed, lavishly illustrated, deliciously tempting book of recipes is certain to do just that. --&gt;</p><p>Will America's appetite for all things under the Tuscan sun ever be satisfied? Not likely with Pino Luongo's <i>Simply Tuscan</i>. Luongo, owner of 10 restaurants and Manhattan's market Tuscan Square, may have spent the past 20 years in the Big Apple, but he is still synchronized to life in the Tuscan countryside. <i>Simply Tuscan</i> honors those rhythms with its seasonal organization and easy mix of food lore, travelogue, and personal reminiscences. Luongo opens with spring (though fall is his favorite season for cooking); in this section, the Italian passion for simplicity--which Luongo constantly endorses--achieves quintessential form in a mache salad topped with quail eggs. The fall section is studded with such treasures as a trio of recipes showcasing the revered <i>tartufo bianco</i>, or white truffle. All the reader really need remember, though, is Luongo's offhand remark on his favorite way of enjoying this delicacy: shaved over fried eggs. <i>Simply Tuscan</i> speaks to cooks of all abilities. The pared-down arrangements of summer and spring will yield memorable results for less-confident cooks who take care to use only the most immaculate and best ingredients. More familiar hands will welcome the savory complexities of the fall and winter menus. Professional cooks will want the book for its bomboloni recipe alone. A favorite from Luongo's childhood, this sweet fritter is used to evaluate potential pastry chefs for his restaurants. If you can't make bomboloni, you'll never cook for Pino. <i>--Sumi Hahn Almquist</i>"Spring means that the cycle is starting all over again. At this time of year, we become like plants, nourished by the warm air and the sun, filling up with power and strength." <br><br>"When you entertain in the summer, think of it as having a date with nature. And keep in mind that nature is not shallow; she will not be impressed with fancy clothes or an expensive serving platter." <br><br>"To Tuscans, fall brings to mind images of brilliant, rich landscapes highlighted by the intense ruby red of the vines after the harvest, and green-brown hills sloping down to the deep, blue sea." <br><br>"In the winter, we need food more than at any other time of year. During this season, it keeps us warm and nourishes us against the cold." <br><br>--from <b>Simply Tuscan</b><br></p><h2>Stone age economics (Social Science Paperbacks)</h2><p><p>Since its first publication over forty years ago Marshall Sahlins's <em>Stone Age Economics</em> has established itself as a classic of modern anthropology and arguably one of the founding works of anthropological economics. Ambitiously tackling the nature of economic life and how to study it comparatively, Sahlins radically revises traditional views of the hunter-gatherer and so-called primitive societies, revealing them to be the original "affluent society." </p> <p>Sahlins examines notions of production, distribution and exchange in early communities and examines the link between economics and cultural and social factors. A&nbsp;radical study of tribal economies, domestic production for livelihood, and of the submission of domestic production to the material and political demands of society at large,&nbsp;<em>Stone Age Economics</em>&nbsp;regards the economy as a&nbsp;category of culture rather than behaviour, in a class with politics and religion rather than rationality or prudence. Sahlins concludes, controversially, that the experiences of those living in subsistence economies may actually have been better, healthier and more fulfilled than the millions enjoying the affluence and luxury afforded by the economics of modern industrialisation and agriculture.</p> <p></p> <p>This Routledge Classics edition includes a new foreword by David Graeber, London School of Economics.</p> <p></p></p><p><p><strong>Marshall Sahlins</strong> is Charles F.

It is based on a psychoanalytic knowledge of the psychosocial development of human beings.</p><p>Caroline Garland is a Psycho-analyst, and Consultant Clinical Psychologist who has taught psychoanalytic group therapy in the Adult Department of the Tavistock Clinic for 25 years. Her background included three years&#x2019; study of social development in chimpanzees as well as observation of the behaviour of new-born infants at the Behaviour Development Research Unit of St. Mary&#x2019;s Hospital. She taught group psychotherapy at the Maudsley Hospital from 1983 - 1997.

Currently she is engaged in the long-term Tavistock Outcome Study of treatment-resistant depression.&#x201c;This book is very important both for psychoanalysis and for social science. Psychoanalysis began with the treatment of individuals and in its early days attended to the conflict between the individual&#x2019;s wishes and society. It was not for some time that it fully addressed the fact that the ostensible individual was a social animal, who was never outside his group even when ostensibly alone. In this book what has been learnt from the study in depth of individual psychopathology is brought to bear on what can be learnt from studying people in groups and vice versa. This integration is a challenge to both, and is perhaps the most relevant in contemporary psychoanalysis.&#x201d; (Dr Ron Britton, Psychoanalyst, former President)<br><br>&#x201c;This excellent book provides impressive depth, and refreshing clarity of expression and thinking about psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, as well as insights about group life more broadly. The editor&#x2019;s profound conviction in the value of psychological work done by groups, her masterful use of psychoanalytic theory to understand group life, and the liveliness of the clinical examples (often of patients with severe difficulties) make it very pleasurable to read.

So demonstrates Mark Harrison in this pathbreaking investigation of the intimate connections between trade and disease throughout modern history. For centuries commerce has been the single most important factor in spreading diseases to different parts of the world, the author shows, and today the same is true. But in today's global world, commodities and germs are circulating with unprecedented speed.</p><p>Beginning with the plagues that ravaged Eurasia in the fourteenth century, Harrison charts both the passage of disease and the desperate measures to prevent it. He examines the emergence of public health in the Western world, its subsequent development elsewhere, and a recurring pattern of misappropriation of quarantines, embargoes, and other sanitary measures for political or economic gain&#x2014;even for use as weapons of war. In concluding chapters the author exposes the weaknesses of today's public health regulations&#x2014;a set of rules that not only disrupt the global economy but also fail to protect the public from the afflictions of trade-borne disease.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark Harrison</b> is professor of the history of medicine and director of the Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine, University of Oxford.

He lives in Oxford, UK.</p>'Mark Harrison brings unrivalled expertise as a medical historian to his masterly account of how contagion and commerce have marched ahead together over the centuries. He shows that the weapons we use against the spread of infection have grown ever more sophisticated without becoming any more effective. Far from protecting mankind in general, they have often been manipulated to give extra advantage to rich over poor nations. This is genuinely global history, powerful and provocative, and a work of remarkable range and originality.'&#x2014;Paul Slack, author of <i>From Reformation to Improvement: Public Welfare in Early Modern England</i> (Paul Slack)<br><br>'Mankind has for millennia conveyed trade goods over vast distances, and along with them, deadly pathogens.

This compact, compelling volume is essential reading for the concerned citizen of an increasingly connected, interdependent, and vulnerable planet.'&#x2014;William J. Bernstein, author of <i>A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World</i> (William Bernstein)<br><br>'Mark Harrison's fascinating and thoroughly researched study traces the connections between trade and infectious diseases, exploring the diplomatic and political ramifications of quarantine and other measures taken to limit the spread of disease.

One of the "New York Five," he has been a leading figure in the architectural community for many years, as teacher, as founder and former director of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, and as builder. This long-awaited book is a rich and complex investigation of his first six houses, which he calls "Houses of Cards" and specifically about House IV and House VI. In these houses, Eisenman has tried to strip architecture of its traditional meanings and associations, making the planes, walls, and elements of the houses as valueless as an arrangement of playing cards.<br> This book contains the architect's own texts on House IV and House VI, which he wrote in 1974, and 1976, as they were being designed, as well as an overview in which he places these houses in the context of his work as a whole. In his essay Manfredo Tafuri offers a psychological perspective; in hers Rosalind Krauss provides cultural and historical contexts. The book is profusely illustrated with sketches, diagrams, and photographs. In some ways, the book itself becomes a new project--somewhat of a metaphor for Eisenman's new approach to architecture--layered with "absences and presences," a complex fiction.</p><p><br><em>About the Authors</em>:<br> <strong>Peter Eisenman</strong> is a partner in the firm of Eisenman Robertson.

Through the creation of this course, which he ended up teaching five times, first at the Naropa Institute and later at Brooklyn College, Ginsberg saw an opportunity to present the history of Beat Literature in his own inimitable way. Compiled and edited by renowned Beat scholar Bill Morgan, and with an introduction by Anne Waldman, <i>The Best Minds of My Generation</i> presents the lectures in edited form, complete with notes, and paints a portrait of the Beats as Ginsberg knew them: friends, confidantes, literary mentors, and fellow revolutionaries.<br> <br> Ginsberg was seminal to the creation of a public perception of Beat writers and knew all of the major figures personally, making him uniquely qualified to be the historian of the movement. In <i>The Best Minds of My Generation</i>, Ginsberg shares anecdotes of meeting Kerouac, Burroughs, and other writers for the first time, explains his own poetics, elucidates the importance of music to Beat writing, discusses visual influences and the cut-up method, and paints a portrait of a group who were leading a literary revolution. For Beat aficionados and neophytes alike, <i>The Best Minds of My Generation</i> is a personal yet critical look at one of the most important literary movements of the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Allen Ginsberg</b> (1926 1997) was a poet, activist, and one of the Beat Generation's most renowned writers. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and co-founder of the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa Institute. He won the National Book Award for Poetry and his groundbreaking poem <i>Howl</i> is one of the most widely read and translated poems of the century.<br><br><b>Bill Morgan</b> has written and edited thirty-nine books, including <i>I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg</i>.<br><br><b>Anne Waldman</b> is an internationally acclaimed poet, scholar, and activist.

Comer's</b> book, <b> <i>Hands-On Networking with Internet Technologies,</i> </b> upholds the assertion that the best way to learn is by doing. Through laboratory experimentation, students and professionals gain a better understanding of how computer networks and Internet technologies operate in practice. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Organized into sections that focus on the hardware and software platforms of different lab facilities, this book systematically constructs and augments a practical knowledge of networking. From single computer applications to advanced network systems engineering, a broad spectrum of hands-on experiments addresses a variety of difficulty levels, and guides the user to a deeper comprehension of the functionality and subtleties of networking in action.</p><p><p> A professor at Purdue University, <b> <i>Douglas E. Comer</i></b><i> </i> develops and teaches courses in computer networking and internetworking. His series of books on networking and TCP/IP protocols receives the highest acclaim; his books are popular worldwide. One of the researchers who contributed to the formation of the Internet in the late 1970s and 1980s, he served on the Internet Architecture Board, is a Fellow of the ACM, and was appointed to the ACM/IEEE joint curriculum committee that recommended laboratories in computer science and engineering curricula. Dr. Comer consults for industry and lectures about the Internet to hundreds of professionals and diverse audiences around the world at professional conferences and on-site presentations. </p><p> Network engineers, managers, programmers, professors and students have all asked how they can gain a deeper understanding of computer networks and internets. This book answers the question. It asserts that the best way to learn is by doing&#x2014;there is no good substitute for hands-on experience with a real network. Interconnecting hardware, configuring network systems, measuring performance, observing protocols in action, and creating client-server programs that communicate over a network all help sharpen one's understanding and appreciation. </p> <p> What hardware and software facilities are required for hands-on experimentation? Instead of specifying an exact platform, this book is organized into six sections that each consider a hardware platform and outline experiments that can be carried out using the hardware. The first section begins by considering the smallest possible facility, a single stand-alone computer. Successive sections describe increasingly more powerful (and more expensive) facilities and the experiments they support. The last sections document advanced hardware and software facilities used for protocol development and network systems engineering. The point is that experimentation is always possible&#x2014;although the facilities at hand determine the types of experiments that can be performed, even low-cost, general-purpose facilities offer opportunities. </p> <p> The broadest distinction among facilities concerns isolation. Early sections of the book describe experiments that can be carried out on conventional, general-purpose computers connected to a production network. Later sections describe experiments such as packet capture, intranet configuration, and protocol development that require a special, dedicated facility. Industry often uses the terms <i>testbed</i> or <i>testnet</i> to describe a separate dedicated facility; academia usually uses the term laboratory. An industrial testbed can serve two purposes. Like an academic laboratory, a testbed provides an environment that supports training. In addition the testbed provides a safe environment in which new or upgraded network systems can be configured, measured, and tested before being installed in the company's production network. Although we use the academic term laboratory throughout the book, many of the experiments are designed with industrial testbeds in mind. In the section on configuration, for example, experiments specify using an isolated facility to configure hosts, routers, and a firewall to form an intranet. </p> <p> In addition to a wide variety of topics, the experiments in this book cover a wide range of difficulty. Some experiments, especially those near the beginning of each chapter, are straightforward and may require less than a half hour to perform. Other experiments are both difficult and lengthy. For example, the IP router experiment described in Chapter 20 is taken from a second-year graduate class that I teach at Purdue. Students work in teams and require most of a semester to build a working IP router. Most experiments list optional extensions that suggest ways to go beyond the basics. The best students in my classes work through all the options, and sometimes invent options of their own. </p> <p> Networking professionals who are working alone can pick and choose among experiments in various chapters. Programmers will focus on the client-server experiments in Parts I and II; system administrators will focus on the configuration experiments in Part IV. Engineers who implement and optimize network systems and protocol stacks will focus on the performance measurements in Part III or protocol development experiments in Parts V and VI. </p> <p> Professors teaching networking courses can choose experiments appropriate to the class. Most colleges and universities cram all of networking and internetworking into a single one-semester overview course. In such a course, students should see a wide range of experiments to acquaint them with all aspects of the subject, especially network programming, network measurement, and protocol analysis. For example, students in my undergraduate class begin the first week using Internet applications and writing programs as described in Part II. When the lectures cover Local Area Networks, the students are assigned measurement experiments from Part III. The weeks that the lectures cover IP and TCP, students perform packet capture and protocol analysis experiments from Part III. Finally, students are ready to tackle a more advanced (socket) programming experiment from Part III. </p> <p> Colleges and universities fortunate enough to have multiple courses in networking can divide the experiments in this book among the courses and go into more depth in each. In a one-semester network programming course students concentrate on the programming experiments in Part III. Students in such a course also enjoy building the internet emulation gateway from Chapter 8 and constructing a library for the simplified API. If students do not have any previous experience, they can begin by using the simplified API in Part II, which allows them to start programming before they learn the details of sockets. I usually encourage students in a network programming course to incorporate the optional extensions and to think about ways the software can be parameterized. </p> <p> In a one-semester network administration course, students can focus on the configuration experiments in Part IV. Students enjoy creating their own version of an intranet, and are especially pleased when they can configure unconventional domain names. As an interesting challenge, I ask students to establish two apparently unrelated domain hierarchies for the same set of computers. </p> <p> Finally, in any course that discusses protocol design, students should begin by building the Internet emulation gateway described in Chapter 8. The gateway project requires students to extend their knowledge of socket programming to include UDP, allows them to see an application gateway, and causes them to consider the possible errors with which protocols must contend (i.e., packet loss, duplication, corruption, and delay). </p></p><h2>Avant-Garde Film: Forms, Themes and Passions (Short Cuts)</h2><p><i>Avant-Garde Film: Forms, Themes and Passions</i> examines the variety of concerns and practices that have comprised the long history of avant-garde film at a level appropriate for undergraduate study. It covers the developments of experimental film-making since the modernist explosion in the 1920s in Europe through to the Soviet film experiments, the American Underground cinema and the French New Wave, structuralism and contemporary gallery work of the young British artists. Through in-depth case-studies, the book introduces students not only to the history of the avant-garde but also to varied analytical approaches to the films themselves - ranging from abstraction (Richter, Ruttmann) to surreal visions (Bunuel, Wyn Evans), underground subversion (Jack Smith, Warhol) to experimental narrative (Deren and Antonioni).</p><p>Michael O&#39;Pray is Reader in Film in School of Art and Design, University of East London and has published widely on experimental cinema and artists&#39; film and video.</p><h2>William Pope.L: The Friendliest Black Artist in America</h2><p><p>The artist William Pope.L, who teaches at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, has been producing some of the most original visual and performing art in America for many years. But it was not until the Acting Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts overturned the recommendations of the NEA's own advisory panel to support this publication and the exhibition it accompanies that Pope.L became the subject of feature articles in the nation's major newspapers. Pope.L became a cause celebre as a result of the scandal, but he deserved to be known long before that. His work is humane, accessible, profound, and humorous; it is also deeply challenging and self-aware. It is neither an accident nor a joke that his business card reads "Friendliest Black Artist in America."</p><p>Many of Pope.L's pieces take place on the street. He has eaten and regurgitated copies of The Wall Street Journal, tied himself to a bank door and handed out money (a sort of reverse panhandler), crawled up the Bowery wearing a business suit, and walked down 125th Street in Harlem wearing a 12-foot white cardboard phallus. Although he frequently deals with racial issues, his work confounds preconceptions of what "black art" should be.</p><p>This book, which accompanies a nationally touring exhibition of Pope.L's work, explores his impact on American art and culture. It contains sections on practices, body, performance, dialogue, consumption, and a selection of the artist's writings and a chronology. The essays are by Mark H. C. Bessire, Suzanne Preston Blier, C.

Dunne introduces 34 species of diurnal raptors?kites, vultures, falcons, eagles, hawks, harriers and ospreys. He presents his material anecdotally in fictional settings that include all the significant factors of raptor life. This approach is effective for most subjects, but a wisecracking raven in his story of a lead-poisoned, dying golden eagle seems inappropriate. Generally, Dunne attempts to convey what it is like to be a bird of prey, especially when it is airborne. There are dramatic stories: a Peregrine falcon defending her nest from a wolverine, a rough-leffed hawk struggling offshore. Dunne's vivid descriptions are matched by Sibley's fine illustrations. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Natural Standard Herb and Supplement Handbook: The Clinical Bottom Line</h2><p>This must-have handbook gives the clinical facts on 91 key herbs and supplements.

Although many versions exist of the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, <i>Le Morte d'Arthur</i> by Sir Thomas Malory endures as the most moving and richly inventive.<br><br>In this abridged retelling the inimitable Peter Ackroyd transforms Malory's fifteenth-century work into a dramatic modern story, vividly bringing to life a world of courage and chivalry, magic, and majesty. The golden age of Camelot, the perilous search for the Holy Grail, the love of Guinevere and Lancelot, and the treachery of Arthur's son Mordred are all rendered into contemporary prose with Ackroyd's characteristic charm and panache. Just as he did with his fresh new version of Chaucer's <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, Ackroyd now brings one of the cornerstones of English literature to a whole new audience.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

He wrote <i>Le Morte D'Arthur</i>, the first great English prose epic, while imprisoned in Newgate. The epic was published in 1485 by William Caxton, the first English printer. Malory is believed to have died in 1471.&#x201c;In this ingenious decanting of an old wine into a new bottle, [Peter Ackroyd] has taken a glorious part of our cultural heritage and made it more accessible to the readers of the 21st century.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b><i>The Sunday Telegraph</i></b><br>&#x201c;Peter Ackroyd's lightly trimmed and streamlined <i>Le Morte d'Arthur</i> makes it eminently readable.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b><i>Sunday Times</i></b><br>&#x201c;The majesty of Malory's book survives too, not least in the final chapters telling of the internal conflicts that destroy the Round Table, the passion of Lancelot and Guinevere, and the destiny that Arthur has had coming to him for a long time: death in battle. This, as retold by Peter Ackroyd, remains a bizarre but thrilling piece of writing.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><h2>Common Japanese Collocations: A Learner&#39;s Guide to Frequent Word Pairings</h2><p>Collocations are word combinations that occur in natural speech more frequently than can be explained by chance. In English, we say, "take a bath" (or "have a bath" in British English), but in Japanese the equivalent is "get in a bath," o-furo ni hairu. The verb hairu is the one that collocates with o-furo.<br>It has long been recognized that the study of collocations can lead to more natural language production, and yet until now there has been no book on the subject for learners of Japanese. <i>Common Japanese Collocations</i> will be the first resource to introduce the most frequently used noun-and-verb and noun-and-adjective combinations.<br>The book is divided into six thematic chapters centering on daily life. Each chapter presents more than a hundred key entries, which consist of a noun and a selection of words that go with that noun. Some collocations come with example sentences that demonstrate how the word pair can be used in a sentence. In addition, throughout the book there are notes on common usage errors.</p><p>If you are a beginning student of Japanese, chances are you often struggle to find the right combination of words to make yourself understood. If you are an intermediate student, perhaps you get by in day-to-day communication, but your spoken Japanese doesn't sound as natural as you would like it to. Whatever the case, <i>Common Japanese Collocations</i> will serve you well.<br><br>Within the pages of this book are more than 3,200 collocations, or word combinations, used in everyday speech. By using these at appropriate moments, your spoken Japanese will sound more natural--and more sophisticated, meaning that you will make a better impression on those around you. Further, by studying the expressions in this book, you will enrich your vocabulary and gain a deeper understanding of Japanese thought and culture.<br><br>The book is divided into six chapters--Home, Daily Life, People, School &amp; Work, Travel, and Entertainment--within which collocations are arranged by theme rather than alphabetically, making them easier to study. More than a third of the entries come with an example sentence to show how the combination in question is used in real life. For each kanji character or compound, <i>furigana</i> has been provided, making the book readable to students at all levels.<br><br>In a word, <i>Common Japanese Collocations</i> is the ultimate resource for students wishing to refine their spoken Japanese.<b>KAKUKO SHOJI</b> has been an instructor of Japanese at the University of Hawaii since 1968, and is the author of <i>Basic Connections and Japanese Core Words and Phrases</i> (both published by Kodansha International).

The potential causes and consequences of these conditions, including maternal and paternal incest and its frequent aftermath, prostitution, are also discussed.</p><p>Motherhood confers immense powers, whick some women misuse because of their own emotional problems and the social expectations placed upon them.

Over the next twenty-five years, she wrote ten more books and developed a set of ideas that profoundly influenced the way America and Europe addressed the central questions and dilemmas of World War II. In this concise book, Elisabeth Young-Bruehl introduces her mentor&#x2019;s work to twenty-first-century readers. Arendt&#x2019;s ideas, as much today as in her own lifetime, illuminate those issues that perplex us, such as totalitarianism, terrorism, globalization, war, and radical evil.&#x201d;<br><br>Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, who was Arendt&#x2019;s doctoral student in the early 1970s and who wrote the definitive biography of her mentor in 1982, now revisits Arendt&#x2019;s major works and seminal ideas. Young-Bruehl considers what Arendt&#x2019;s analysis of the totalitarianism of Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union can teach us about our own times, and how her revolutionary understanding of political action is connected to forgiveness and making promises for the future. The author also discusses <i>The Life of the Mind</i>, Arendt&#x2019;s unfinished meditation on how to think about thinking. Placed in the context of today&#x2019;s political landscape, Arendt&#x2019;s ideas take on a new immediacy and importance.

In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, leading authority Jonathan Slack offers a clear and informative overview of stem cells--what they are, what scientists do with them, what stem cell therapies are available today, and how they might be used in the future. Slack explains the difference between embryonic stem cells, which exist only in laboratory cultures, and tissue-specific stem cells, which exist in our bodies, and he discusses how embryonic stem cells may be used in the future to treat such illnesses as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, spinal trauma, and retinal degeneration. But he stresses that, despite important advances, the clinical applications of stem cells are still in their infancy and that most real stem cell therapy today is some form of bone marrow transplantation. Slack concludes by analyzing how medical innovation has occurred in this area in recent years and he draws out some of the lessons for the development of new therapies in the future.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Slack</strong> is Director of the Stem Cell Institute at the University of Minnesota, where he also holds the Tulloch Chair of Stem Cell Biology.<br>I would recommend this clearly written book to everyone. * Simon McGurk, Nursing Standard *</p><h2>A Layman Looks at the Lord&#39;s Prayer</h2><p><p><b>A fresh look at a famous prayer</b><i></i></p><p><i>&#x201c;There is inherent in this prayer all the strength and compassion of our Father in heaven.

It is necessary, authoritative and thorough. The timing of this book is superb! --Karla F.C. Holloway, Duke UniversityThe influence of African American literature can be attributed, in no small part, to the literary theorists gathered in this collection. This is a superb anthology that represents a diversity of voices and points of view, and a much needed historical retrospective of how African American literary theory has developed. --Marlon B. Ross, University of MichiganA volume of great conceptual significance and originality in its focus on the development of African American literary theory. --Farah Jasmine Griffin, University of PennsylvaniaAfrican American Literary Theory: A Reader is the first volume to document the central texts and arguments in African American literary theory from the 1920s through the present. As the volume progresses chronologically from the rise of a black aesthetic criticism, through the Blacks Arts Movement, feminism, structuralism and poststructuralism, and the rise of queer theory, it focuses on the key arguments, themes, and debates in each period.By constantly bringing attention to the larger political and cultural issues at stake in the interpretation of literary texts, the critics gathered here have contributed mightily to the prominence and popularity of African American literature in this country and abroad. African American Literary Theory provides a unique historical analysis of how these thinkers have shaped literary theory, and literature at large, and will be a indispensable text for the study of African American intellectual culture.Contributors include Sandra Adell, Michael Awkward, Houston A.

Thus, I have included such things as a proof of Schwarz&#39;s inequality, theorems on uniformly bounded families of analytic functions, properties of Stieltjes integrals, and an introduction to the matrix calculus. I have presupposed a knowledge of the elementary properties of linear fractional transformations in the complex plane. ``It has not been my intention to write a complete treatise on the subject of continued fractions, covering all the literature, but rather to present a unified theory correlating certain parts and applications of the subject within a larger analytic structure ... &#39;&#39; --from the Preface</p><p></p><h2>A Cry Like a Bell (Wheaton Literary)</h2><p><b>In this collection of poems of human struggle and God's grace,&nbsp;Madeleine L'Engle speaks across the centuries through the voices of biblical figures, like Rachel, Isaac, Mary, and Andrew.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Every one of us will find at least one character with whom we can identify&#x2014;their dilemmas and struggles, moments of joy, and heart longings.&nbsp;Their dramatic songs echo in our minds and touch us afresh with belief in God's grace and love, no matter what our situations.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>A Cry Like a Bell</i></b><br>"Whether in her prose or poetry, Madelein L'Engle brings illumination to her themes through her blend of insight and honesty."<b> &#x2014;Edmund Fuller</b><br><br>"She speaks with the awesomely stark clarity that marks the imagination of real poets.

Here you will learn about the nature of people and how their behavior is influenced by others in organizations. You will study some basics of individual motivation, attitudes, and decision making, and see how these human tendencies can be forged into productive and ethical actions. You will read about how people are influenced by the politics and culture of an organization, and also how people may themselves shape the environment in which they work. Finally, you will study what it takes to be creative in an organizational setting, with tips about how to lead organizations in new and innovative directions. </p> <p> This book is organized into four major dimensions. In each, one or more "foundation" readings are presented in which basic knowledge from the organizational sciences is reviewed. Then "applications" are presented from the literature of organizational behavior. The readings cover most of the major topics in the organizational behavior field and reflect the current state of our knowledge. Some chapters are research summaries; some are think pieces. All have been selected by the combined criteria of writing style and content. Thus, if a piece appears a bit dry, bear with it; it should contain enough content to be worth the effort. If a piece is especially interesting, enjoy the experience. When you finish this anthology, you should not only understand more about how people think and behave, but have some new ideas about how such behavior can be combined to build a productive and healthy organization. </p></p><h2>INFORMATION SERVICES TODAY:AN INTRODUCTI</h2><p>This book is an essential overview of what it means to be a library and information professional.

Our genes respond to everything we do, according to the revolutionary new science of epigenetics. In other words, our inherited DNA doesn't rigidly determine our health and disease prospects as the previous generation of geneticists believed. Especially in the last ten years, scientists have confirmed that the vast majority of our genes are actually fluid and dynamic. An endless supply of new studies prove that our health is an expression of how we live our lives--that what we eat and think and how we handle daily stress, plus the toxicity of our immediate environment--creates an internal biochemistry that can actually turn genes on or off. Managing these biochemical effects on our genome is the new key to radiant wellness and healthy longevity.</p><p>Now gaining broad credibility among scientists, the study of epigenetics is at the forefront of modern medicine. According to the author, the real upshot of the epigenetic revolution is that it opens the door to what futurists call personalized medicine. For the first time in a trade book, Dr. Pelletier explains in layperson's language the genetic biomarkers that will become the standard reference for measuring which specific lifestyle changes are required to optimize a given individual's health. In the very near future, each person's state-of-the-art genetic and epigenetic profile--matched with other precise indicators such as assays of the gut microbiome--will guide their daily health practices.</p><p>This short but profound book by a world-renowned pioneer in integrative medicine introduces readers to this exciting new field, and reveals the steps that each of us can take today to change our genetic expression and thereby optimize our health for a lifetime.</p></p><p><b>Kenneth R.

With World War I, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Russian Civil War as backdrop, it's an old-fashioned, blood-and-guts narrative, filled with earthly humor and a wealth of colorful characters. The story concerns the fluctuating fortunes of Grigory Melekhov, a young Cossack who is both a hero and a victim of the uprising. This new edition, advertised as being "complete and uncensored," is agreeably readable-a major plus given the work's length and complex scope-although the dialog sometimes offers an incongruous mix of Briticisms (e.g., blighters and buggers) and backwoods American expressions (mebbe not and baccy). The editor, a Slavonic scholar, provides a valuable introduction, notes, bibliography, and background essays.

Few of such efforts met with much success, and it was not until 1856 that a major reform was initiated. Legislation was issued which affected all spheres of clerical activity but the most vital and controversial aspect of the reform involved the measures adopted to dispossess the Church of its wealth. The extensive ecclesiastical holdings of urban and rural real estate and capital were nationalized and redistributed. Professor Bazant examines earlier attempts at nationalization, and describes in detail the implementations of the 1856 Lerdo Law and subsequent decrees. Using selected areas of the country, he traces the precise effects of the redistribution of Church property and capital, describing the terms of sale or transfer, the number of sales, the buyers, their nationality and occupation, and the total value of the amounts involved.</p><p>Professor Bazant describes in detail the implementations of the 1856 Lerdo Law and subsequent decrees.

Celebrated by a month of elaborate pageantry that required a full year of preparations, the wedding mobilized the combined artistic, intellectual, and administrative forces of Tuscany at the zenith of its wealth, power, and cultural prestige. This book combines art and social history to present the first comprehensive reconstruction of the Medici wedding and in the process provides a fascinating narrative of Florentine culture during the Renaissance.<br><br>James Saslow draws on a rich trove of visual and archival sources to describe the jousts, plays, musical-dramatic<i> intermedi</i>, processions, and tournaments that celebrated the wedding; the artists, musicians, and architects who created and organized the events; and the bureaucratic administration that sustained this Renaissance "theater of the world." His sources include producers' daily logbooks and detailed records of the design process, staff, payments, and logistics, as well as eighty-eight set and costume drawings, paintings, and prints, which appear in a catalogue included in the book. Saslow's study will be of interest to practitioners and historians of theater, dance, music, and the visual arts, as well as to students of political and economic history and cultural studies.</p><p><b>James M. Saslow</b> is associate professor of art history at Queens College, City University of New York. He is also the author of <i>Ganymede in the Renaissance: Homosexuality in Art and Society</i> and <i>The Poetry of Michelangelo: An Annotated Translation</i>, both published by Yale University Press.A detailed account of theatrical pageants celebrating one of the most sumptuous weddings of Renaissance Italy. Ferdinando de' Medici had been a cardinal since age 14 and was known as a religious reformer and a patron of the arts. The death of his elder brother forced him to leave the church to rescue the dynasty from extinction. His marriage to Christine de Lorraine cemented an important political alliance and brought Florence an enormous dowry from the French. Saslow (Art History/Queens College) guides us through the ten months of preparations for the events and the actual pageants, which began with Christine's arrival at Livorno on April 24 and lasted until June 8. Attractions included triumphal entries, mock naval battles against the Turks, and a soccer match. Saslow is particularly interested in the series of intermedi, which were allegorical tableaux inserted between the acts of comedies in the Medici Theater. They involved the use of instrumental music, song, dance, and splendid costumes and stage designs, and they featured classical characters, such as nymphs and shepherds, Bacchus and Apollo, and the figures of Rhythm and Harmony--all glorifying the ruling couple and wishing them offspring. Saslow is a conscious admirer of Michel Foucault (he tends to write like him), and he interprets this rich material both as fine art and as an artifact of social and political control. Drawing on published texts, sketches, paintings and prints (many of which are superbly reproduced here), and manuscript sources, such as stage manager Girolamo Seriacopi's daily production logbook, our author explores such details of backstage life as salaries, working conditions, and the incipient roles of women. Valuable reading for students of Renaissance society and the performing arts. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

How have the relatively benign post-Ice Age conditions affected the evolution and spread of humanity across the globe? By setting our genetic history in the context of climate change during prehistory, the origin of many features of our modern world are identified and presented in this illuminating book. It reviews the aspects of our physiology and intellectual development that have been influenced by climatic factors, and how features of our lives - diet, language and the domestication of animals - are also the product of the climate in which we evolved. In short: climate change in prehistory has in many ways made us what we are today. Climate Change in Prehistory weaves together studies of the climate with anthropological, archaeological and historical studies, and will fascinate all those interested in the effects of climate on human development and history.</p><p>This book explores the challenges that faced humankind in a glacial climate and the opportunities that arose when the climate improved dramatically after the Ice Age.

She thrived in her role as an intimate of power brokers in Gilded Age Washington, where she was admired for her wit and taste by such luminaries as Henry James, H. H. Richardson, and General William Tecumseh Sherman. Clover so clearly possessed, as one friend wrote, &#x201c;all she wanted, all this world could give.&#x201d; <br><br>Yet at the center of her story is a haunting mystery. Why did Clover, having begun in the spring of 1883 to capture her world vividly through photography, end her life less than three years later by drinking a chemical developer she used in the darkroom? The key to the mystery lies, as Natalie Dykstra&#x2019;s searching account makes clear, in Clover&#x2019;s photographs themselves. <br><br>The aftermath of Clover&#x2019;s death is equally compelling. Dykstra probes Clover&#x2019;s enduring reputation as a woman betrayed. And, most movingly, she untangles the complex, poignant &#x2014; and universal &#x2014; truths of her shining and impossible marriage. </p><p>www.nataliedykstra.com <br><br></p></p><p><strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Author Natalie Dykstra</strong> <br> <br> <p><strong>Q: What was it about <em>Clover</em> that first drew you in?</strong> <br></p> <p><strong> A:</strong> I&#x2019;d heard about Clover on the margins of other lives&#x2014;her husband, Henry Adams, of course, but also Alice James, Henry James, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and others. Clover had long fascinated people&#x2014;she was married to a famous man, led a privileged life in Boston and Washington, D.C., and at forty-two years old she committed suicide. She&#x2019;s a mysterious figure and the mystery is only deepened by the haunting statue, sculpted by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, that marks her grave in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. When I read about how Eleanor Roosevelt would take a horse and carriage and sit in front of Clover&#x2019;s memorial, I got curious about this woman who so fascinated Mrs. Roosevelt. Knowing Clover had been a serious amateur photographer, I began to wonder if answers about her life and what had happened might be found in her photographs. When I went to the Massachusetts Historical Society for the first time to look at her photograph collection, it was as if a past world unfolded in front of my eyes. What I saw was exactly what she&#x2019;d seen herself. There was visual evidence that letters don&#x2019;t provide, opening up hidden pathways to her inner life. When I discovered a notebook in which Clover kept a detailed record of her photographs, I realized that she&#x2019;d paid close attention to how she put her photographs into her albums. She wanted her photographs to be viewed in a particular way because she was telling a story&#x2014;her story.</p> <br><strong>Q: Tell us about your sources. What were your best finds? </strong> <p></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Besides her photographs and her notebook, what made it possible to see the whole arc of Clover&#x2019;s life was the discovery of family papers still in private hands, most of which have never been seen before. Suddenly, I could understand the world she&#x2019;d been born into, the ways her family members talked to one another, the love between her father and mother. Also in this private collection is an unknown, heartrending letter written by William James in 1901 to comfort one of Clover&#x2019;s nieces. This letter gave me a new and important way to think about Clover&#x2019;s death and its aftermath.</p> <p><strong>Q: Clover led such a glamorous life in Gilded Age Washington. What are a couple of your favorite images or stories from that time in her life?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Clover and Henry were at the center of the political and cultural life of Washington. Politicians, scientists, artists, writers&#x2014;they all gathered at the Adams&#x2019; home on Lafayette Square for some of Clover&#x2019;s Russian tea and her equally delicious gossip. I love to think of the evening-long talks with the Five of Hearts, a select group consisting of Clover, Henry, Clarence King, and John and Clara Hay, and how they&#x2019;d sit close together in low-slung red-leather chairs around a blazing fire. As Clover said, it was always a "good deal of good talk." I often think of Clover and Henry, bundled up on a cold winter night, walking over for dinner at the White House. They were never very impressed by the presidents during their years in Washington, but Clover enjoyed the drama of those evenings. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman always tried to sit next to Clover at dinner parties&#x2014;he once recreated his "march to the sea" by placing all the dinnerware in the middle of the table and then, in the heat of action, sweeping the table clean, with forks and knives flying everywhere. There was almost nothing Clover enjoyed more than these kinds of moments. But, as glamorous as their lives were in Washington, Clover kept a wary eye on the scene&#x2014;she was no unthinking social butterfly. She craved real friendships. And she was too smart to be completely swept up in what she called the "society rabble."</p> <p><strong>Q: Other than Clover herself, who are your favorite characters in <em>Clover Adams</em>?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> There are so many. I remember looking forward to spending time with H. H. Richardson, architect of Boston&#x2019;s Trinity Church, whom Henry and Clover hired to build their new house in Washington. Richardson was outrageously talented, brimming with life. He was an absolute extrovert&#x2014;and a relief for me after days spent with Henry Adams, who was very much not an extrovert. I was moved by what a good friend John Hay was to the Adamses&#x2014;his letters shine with his generosity. Henry James is such a large figure that he can stride into one&#x2019;s narrative and take over in no time. But he taught me a lot about the restraint of that era, of what to say and what not to say, and his relationship with Clover was revealing&#x2014;they liked each other, but they were both eagle-eyed portraitists of the other.</p> <p>Of course, there&#x2019;s Clover&#x2019;s father, Dr. Hooper, and Lizzie Cameron, a complicated beauty, a rival for Henry&#x2019;s attentions, damaged, and a "dangerously fascinating" woman, as someone put it. But I think a favorite character was Clover&#x2019;s mother, Ellen Sturgis Hooper, about whom we knew very little until I found a stash of her letters in the family papers. She was a talented poet, friend of Emerson and Margaret Fuller, and an expressive, loving mother. She adored Clover. I could hardly bear to write of her death of tuberculosis at the age of thirty-six, when Clover was just six years old. Knowing her more fully, having a sense of her voice in her letters, helped me take full measure of what her loss meant to Clover. In some way, her absence haunts the story.</p> <p><strong>Q: <em>Clover Adams</em> is the story of a woman beginning to become an artist; it&#x2019;s the story of a marriage; and it&#x2019;s also a kind of mystery story. Did you know these would all be strands of your story from the start of your work on <em>Clover</em>?</strong></p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Early on, I started to think of the story as a ghost story because it helped me stay away from making arguments about Clover or proving points&#x2014;I could stay clear of preconceived ideas and focus instead on finding clues to the mystery.</p> <p>Clover was known for her marriage and for committing suicide. The last act of her life had defined her, and she&#x2019;d become no more than an emblem of loss and suffering. This seemed so unfair. To counter the way memory of her had become so stuck in stereotypes, I tried to stay close to her words and her photographs and to understand these sources as fully as possible. Once I was sure I wouldn&#x2019;t get blown off track, I turned to Henry Adams, because I knew that to understand Clover, I had to enter into their marriage. Henry Adams said when he was writing a biography: "a great mass of material is almost as troublesome to a biography as a short allowance." How true. Books both by and about Henry fill the shelves. But I didn&#x2019;t want his Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning voice from his autobiography, <em>The Education of Henry Adams</em>, to take over Clover&#x2019;s story. I had to inch my way toward him. It was finally seeing him as a teacher at Harvard, the same years in which Clover fell in love with him, that enabled me to imagine their relationship and what he brought her. His students adored him. He had an extraordinarily creative mind. Clover couldn&#x2019;t go to college, but Henry opened up what was possible for her to know. They would read together until all hours of night, from French literature and German philosophy to current science and the latest by American authors. What became clear is how compatible they were and how much they loved each other. Henry loved her sense of adventure, her wit. There&#x2019;s a scene of him at dinner, waving his napkin up and down, doubled over with laughter at one of Clover&#x2019;s stories.</p> <p>All of this only deepens the mystery of what went wrong. Something does shift in their marriage&#x2014;it&#x2019;s almost imperceptible at first. Henry&#x2019;s flirtation with a beautiful younger woman, Clover&#x2019;s growing anxiety about not having children, his increasing introversion, and her turn towards photography. The drift in their marriage becomes a chasm they can&#x2019;t bridge. But this happens in the years when Henry was writing a second novel about a woman, this time a "failed artist." And Clover is taking photographs of him and their life together. So he&#x2019;s writing about her, while she&#x2019;s documenting her side of things, and they&#x2019;re doing so in these wonderfully rich and roundabout ways. The clues had been there all along.</p> <p><strong>Q: The haunting Saint-Gaudens statue in Rock Creek Cemetery at Clover&#x2019;s grave has drawn many, women especially, over time. Could you tell us a little about that?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Clover&#x2019;s story resonates. She was a gifted woman who enjoyed enormous privilege&#x2014;in many ways she lived the kind of life not available to most women. And yet, her determination to find a way to express herself, her worries in her marriage, her need for family, her struggle with painful feelings, her deep longing for connection and meaning&#x2014;well, it&#x2019;s a human story, isn&#x2019;t it? It&#x2019;s our story. And I think what the statue most communicates is that no matter what we suffer, we&#x2019;re not defined by our suffering. I think that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s been a source of such comfort over the years.</p> <p></p> <p></p>&#x201c;Natalie Dykstra writes of Clover Adams&#x2019;s striking photographs that they &#x2018;defeat distances between people and make time stand still.&#x2019; Dykstra&#x2019;s biography achieves the same remarkable feat, bringing us close to an inspiring if ultimately tragic life, a celebrated marriage gone awry, a vanished world of privilege where the universally costly emotions of love, loss, and envy nevertheless hold sway. &#x2018;I spare you the inside view of my heart,&#x2019; Clover Adams once wrote to her beloved father. Natalie Dykstra spares nothing in this eloquent and powerfully sympathetic portrait of the artist as a lady, a haunting hymn to women&#x2019;s ways of seeing.&#x201d; &#x2014; Megan Marshall, author of <i>The Peabody Sisters</i><br><br>&#x201c;What happened to Clover Adams broke Henry Adams&#x2019;s heart. And in Natalie Dykstra&#x2019;s splendid retelling, it will break yours. This is a moving book, deeply researched, fast-paced, and profoundly engaging. It is not easy to write a book the family for so long did not want written. Dykstra has succeeded in doing so, and she has returned Clover Adams to us as a living figure.&#x201d; &#x2014; Robert D. Richardson, author of <i>Henry Thoreau: A Life of the Mind</i>, <i>Emerson: The Mind on Fire</i>, and <i>William James: In the Maelstrom of American Modernism</i><br><br>&#x201c;At last, Clover Adams has the biography she deserves. Long glimpsed only as the wife of a famous man or the dazzling hostess to Gilded Age luminaries, she emerges here as a complex and fascinating woman &#x2014; a thinker, writer, and photographer, but also a deeply troubled soul. Natalie Dykstra follows her subject from the academic circles of mid-nineteenth-century Boston to the halls of power in Washington, D.C., giving us a broader portrait of late-nineteenth-century life. But she never loses her focus on Clover and the dark demons that haunted her throughout her life. This is a compelling read, so beautifully written and persuasively argued it&#x2019;s hard to put down.&#x201d; &#x2014; Martha A.

It is aimed at graduate students in their third or fourth year of study who wish to learn the advanced techniques of solid-state theoretical physics. The method of Green&#39;s functions is introduced at the beginning and used throughout. Indeed, it could be considered a book on practical applications of Green&#39;s functions, although I prefer to call it a book on physics. The method of Green&#39;s functions has been used by many theorists to derive equations which, when solved, provide an accurate numerical description of many processes in solids and quantum fluids. In this book I attempt to summarize many of these theories in order to show how Green&#39;s functions are used to solve real problems. My goal, in writing each section, is to describe calculations which can be compared with experiments and to provide these comparisons whenever available. The student is expected to have a background in quantum mechanics at the level acquired from a graduate course using the textbook by either L. I. Schiff, A. S. Davydov, or I. Landau and E. M. Lifshiftz. Similarly, a prior course in solid-state physics is expected, since the reader is assumed to know concepts such as Brillouin zones and energy band theory. Each chapter has problems which are an important part of the lesson; the problems often provide physical insights which are not in the text. Sometimes the answers to the problems are provided, but usually not.</p><p></p><h2>Timeline Charts of the Western Church</h2><p>What do the history of the Quaker church and the women&#39;s suffrage movement have in common?

Now fully updated in its second edition, leading historian Peter Burke offers afresh his accessible guide to the past, present and future of cultural history, as it has been practised not only in the English-speaking world, but also in Continental Europe, Asia, South America and elsewhere. <br> <br> Burke begins by providing a discussion of the 'classic' phase of cultural history, associated with Jacob Burckhardt and Johan Huizinga, and of the Marxist reaction, from Frederick Antal to Edward Thompson. He then charts the rise of cultural history in more recent times, concentrating on the work of the last generation, often described as the 'New Cultural History'. He places cultural history in its own cultural context, noting links between new approaches to historical thought and writing and the rise of feminism, postcolonial studies and an everyday discourse in which the idea of culture plays an increasingly important part. The new edition also surveys the very latest developments in the field and considers the directions cultural history may be taking in the twenty-first century. <br> <br> The second edition of What is Cultural History? will continue to be an essential textbook for all students of history as well as those taking courses in cultural, anthropological and literary studies.</p><p><b>Peter Burke </b>is Professor Emeritus of Cultural History at the University of Cambridge."Peter Burke has done it again!

An altruism acquired by the application of rule and principle? Or, as Noddings asserts, caring and the memory of being cared for? With numerous examples to supplement her rich theoretical discussion, Noddings builds a compelling philosophical argument for an ethics based on natural caring, as in the care of a mother for her child. The ethical behavior that grows out of natural caring, and has as its core care-filled receptivity to those involved in any moral situation, leaves behind the rigidity of rule and principle to focus on what is particular and unique in human relations.<br><br>Noddings's discussion is wide-ranging, as she considers whether organizations, which operate at a remove from the caring relationship, can truly be called ethical. She discusses the extent to which we may truly care for plants, animals, or ideas. Finally, she proposes a realignment of education to encourage and reward not just rationality and trained intelligence, but also enhanced sensitivity in moral matters.</p><p><b>Nel Noddings</b> is Lee Jacks Professor of Education, Emerita, Stanford University.

Neither a how-to book nor a syrupy celebration of universal love, <i>Caring </i>is both for general readers and specialists."--<i>New York Times </i> -- <i>Review</i></p><h2>Science in the Private Interest: Has the Lure of Profits Corrupted Biomedical Research?</h2><p>Something has changed in the culture and values of academic science over the last quarter-century. University science is now entangled with entrepreneurship, and researchers with a commercial interest are caught in an ethical quandary. How can an academic scientist honor knowledge for its own sake, while also using knowledge as a means to generate wealth? Science in the Private Interest investigates the trends and effects of modern, commercialized academic science. This book dives unhesitatingly into some of modern science&#39;s messiest and most urgent questions. How did scientists begin choosing proprietary gain over the pursuit of knowledge? What effects have academic-corporate partnerships had on the quality and integrity of science? And, most importantly, how does this affect the public?</p><p>Sheldon Krimsky is professor of urban and environmental policy and planning at Tufts University. He is the author of six books and over 100 essays and reviews.The title of this book may scare some readers away. They shouldn't let it. Even as it takes an uncompromising stance on the need for scientific integrity, Science in the Private Interest is carefully researched and presents arguments from all sides of the issues under discussion. Case studies sprinkled throughout the book demonstrate that the main characters -- universities, large companies, and some academicians -- at times cloak monetary and career-advancing priorities in scientific clothing. Yet most of the pages of the book are not exposes of biomedical wrongdoing but explanations of the laws and regulations that govern how academia and industry interrelate. In Science in the Private Interest, Sheldon Krimsky explores how scientific discoveries made within academic walls can be translated into better lives for members of the general public. Without the profit motive to stimulate private investment in discoveries with potential application to human need, laboratory breakthroughs might be confined to the pages of a prominent or obscure journal. Yet that same profit-oriented motive introduces a new set of priorities, motivations, and cultural norms into university laboratories and academic investigations. One university official is quoted as saying, "The only thing wrong with tainted money is there t'aint enough of it." Is there a way out of the dilemma? Can corporate funding be made available to translate biomedical advances into beneficial products without allowing the money to distort the purity of scientific inquiry? In an important contribution to scholarly inquiry into university-industry collaboration, Krimsky considers the work of sociologist Robert Merton, who in the 1930s proposed a series of standards by which science should be evaluated. Merton suggested four norms of science. "Universalism" refers to the objective nature of science that transcends national, cultural, or institutional boundaries. "Communalism" stands for public ownership of the fruits of scientific investigation, holding that each scientific advance is built on past discoveries and should not become the private property of a person or institution. Merton's third norm is "disinterestedness," requiring scientists to perform and to interpret their work "without considerations of personal gain, ideology, or fidelity to any cause other than the pursuit of truth." Finally, Merton calls on scientists and their institutions to practice "organized skepticism," suspending final judgment on a discovery until all possible facts are at hand. Krimsky uses these standards to evaluate the state of scientific inquiry in the current era of growing private funding of universities and heightened corporate influence over academic behavior. He struggles with the applicability of Mertonian norms to modern reality. For example, is communalism (public access to scientific knowledge) an absolute yardstick of scientific integrity, given that industry has a reasonable right to patent products (a process requiring secrecy) that its funds help to develop? What kinds of discoveries merit the overriding of communalism? Is it proper to patent objects that already exist in nature, such as genes? Or should knowledge be treated as private property only for such inventions as the vacuum cleaner and the hepatitis B vaccine? This book is worthwhile reading for anyone interested in biomedical innovation. <i>Thomas Bodenheimer, M.D.</i><br>Copyright � 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

This unique volume, which includes Babel&#x2019;s famous <i>Red Cavalry</i> series and his <i>Odessa Stories</i>, is translated, edited, introduced, and annotated by Val Vinokur, a 2008 Guggenheim Fellow in Translation, and features illustrations by Yefim Ladyzhensky, a painter known for his depictions of everyday life under Soviet rule in Babel&#x2019;s native Odessa.<p>Babel was born in 1894 into multicultural Odessa&#x2019;s thriving Jewish community. Working as a journalist, he witnessed the Bolshevik Revolution and Civil War, and accompanied the Cossack horsemen of the Red Cavalry during the 1920 Polish-Soviet War, distilling these experiences into his fiction. Vinokur highlights Babel&#x2019;s &#x201c;horrified hopefulness&#x201d; and &#x201c;doleful and bespectacled Jewish comedy&#x201d; in the face of the bloody conflicts that plagued his generation.</p><p>On the centenary of the revolution that toppled the Romanov tsars, Babel&#x2019;s fictions continue to absorb and fascinate contemporary readers interested in eastern European and Jewish literature as well as the history and politics of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><b>ISAAC BABEL</b> (1894&#x2013;1940) is best known for his short fiction, especially his tales about the Jewish gangsters of Odessa and the Cossacks of the Red Cavalry. A contemporary, Viktor Shklovsky, once described Babel as writing &#x201c;in the same tone about the stars and gonorrhea.&#x201d; Babel was executed on Stalin&#x2019;s orders in 1940 in the wake of the Great Purge.<br><b>YEFIM LADYZHENSKY</b> (1911&#x2013;1982) began his career as a set designer, but devoted his life to painting after encountering Babel&#x2019;s fiction, which he described as having played for him &#x201c;the same role that the Bible and myths did for a multitude of artists&#x2014;a reason and a stimulus for expressing my feelings and experiences.&#x201d; When he emigrated from Odessa to Jerusalem in 1979, the Soviet government impounded his Babel-inspired paintings. To make up for their loss, he quickly completed the eighteen richly detailed drawings for <i>Red Cavalry </i>that are included in this volume.<br><b>VAL VINOKUR </b>is an associate professor of literary studies, chair of liberal arts, and director of Jewish culture at The New School, where he also leads workshops in literary translation. He is the author of <i>The Trace of Judaism: Dostoevsky, Babel, Mandelstam, Levinas</i> (Northwestern University Press, 2008), and has translated several novels from the French with Rose-Myriam R�jouis."I turn to Babel for reassurance that literature is capable of showing the real and terrifying mayhem that results when national systems collapse, while still preserving some modicum of love for human beings. If I ever need my ear tuned, this is where I go. Babel is a particular master of that unnamed space between sentences; the place where, in my view, a piece's real sensibility gets made: What does the writer omit, and how does he link his observations?"<b>-- George Saunders, <i>vulture.com</i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b>"Thankfully, the entirety of&nbsp;<i>Red Calvary</i>&nbsp;is included in Val Vinokur's rich new translation of the "essential fictions," as well as a healthy serving of ten Odessa stories, plus numerous early works and extras. The result is a satisfying journey through the great Judaic author's work, beginning in relative lightness and playfulness, moving through a bulky middle inflected with the realism of reportage, and ending on a note of late enigma...&nbsp;The language here is absolutely rich, although also lapidary; an intricately latticed spiderweb that could support the weight of a tank. Let us hope that its strength is tested by many a reader this year."<b>-- Veronica Scott Esposito, <i>The Brooklyn Rail</i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b>"Translation is the theme of Babel's story 'Guy de Maupassant.' A woman loves Maupassant passionately, but her renditions&nbsp;remain 'tediously correct, lifeless and loud...' The narrator helps: 'I spent all night hacking a&nbsp;path through someone else's translation,' he explains (Vinokur). 'A phrase is born into the world both good and bad at the same&nbsp;time. The secret lies in a barely discernible twist. The lever should rest in your hand, getting warm. You must turn it once, but not&nbsp;twice.' Too often, Morison turns it twice, and Dralyuk not at all. Vinokur gets the right effect most often."&nbsp;<br><b>--Gary Saul Morson,&nbsp;<i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br>"Vinokur's lucid translation brilliantly conveys the vivid precision and the emotional edge of Isaac Babel's prose to the English-language reader."&nbsp;<br><b>--Anya Ulinich, author of&nbsp;<i>Lena Finkle's Magic Barrel</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Petropolis</i>&nbsp;</b><br>"Vinokur inspires confidence in his ability to produce an edition of Babel's stories...more faithful to the original, both literally and&nbsp;stylistically, than any other available in English."&nbsp;<br><b>--Carol J. Avins, editor of&nbsp;<i>Isaac Babel, 1920 Diary</i>&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<i>Border Crossings: The West and Russian Identity in Soviet&nbsp;Literature, 1917-1934</i>&nbsp;</b><br><br>'To translate Babel is to attempt to invent, or reinvent, a language--a Jewish language--particularly given Babel's predilection for&nbsp;marrying the argot of the underworld with highly sophisticated narration. What would its English equivalent be? Saul Bellow's&nbsp;high-low American English? Jackie Mason's tonalities? Mickey Katz's lyrics? Yeshiva talk? None of these seem quite right, but it&nbsp;is clear that Vinokur is willing to experiment. There is an iconic scene in "The King": A nameless young man interrupts Dvoira&nbsp;Krik's wedding celebration. He gets Benya's attention with a phrase that betrays a Yiddishism lurking behind it, with two twisted&nbsp;conjugations and a well-misused word. There isn't a trace of this in Peter Constantine's fine 2002 translation, but Vinokur takes a&nbsp;chance with "I got a couple things to tell you." The dropped preposition may not create a sense of an invented language, but it&nbsp;hints at something lurking underneath, as does, for example, "Benya, you know what kind of notion I got? I got a notion our&nbsp;chimney's on fire," which, too, is smoothed over in Constantine's work.'<br><b>--Jake Marmer,&nbsp;<i>Jewish Review of Books&nbsp;</i></b><br>"Isaac Babel wrote amazingly powerful, stinging sentences of almost brutal, always poetic compactness. &nbsp;It is a gift to have these&nbsp;sentences in this collection of Babel's stories and short essays, translated by the talented Val Vinokur."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>--Richard Bernstein, former book critic for the&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;and columnist for&nbsp;<i>The International Herald Tribune</i></b> <br><br>[Vinokur's] translations were done with attention, knowledge, and deference to the works of Isaac Babel - but most importantly, the personal inspiration and energy which he lent this great writer in the English language...&nbsp;Vinokur...has created a single volume that would, as the title suggests, encompass what he sees as all of Babel's essential fictions - including [Red&nbsp;Cavalry and the Odessa Tales] along with over twenty other stories, creating a perspective on the author's life and work. This perspective is evident in his notes, which offer a running commentary on stylistic and thematic issues present in Babel's work, and also provide a window into the translation process.

It provides extensive coverage of general equilibrium models of money, models of the short-run real effects of monetary policy, and game-theoretic approaches to monetary policy. Among the topics covered are money-in-the-utility-function models, cash-in-advance models, money and public finance, the credit channel of money, models of time consistency, monetary policy operating procedures, and interest rates and monetary policy.<br> <br> The book uses dynamic simulations to evaluate quantitatively the significance of the channels through which monetary policy and inflation affect the economy. It extensively examines modern approaches to monetary policy that stress the incentives facing central banks and the strategic interactions between central banks and the private sector. Where most treatments of monetary policy emphasize money supply control and money demand, this book focuses on the implications of interest rate control for monetary policy. The book is designed for advanced graduate students in monetary economics, economic researchers, and economists working in policy institutions and central banks.<br> <br> This second edition includes new discussions of empirical evidence on the interest elasticity of money demand, the fiscal theory of the price level, the new Keynesian model, optimal policies in forward-looking models, stability and the Taylor principle, and open economy new Keynesian models. It also expands its coverage of multiple equilibria, the role of timing assumptions in cash-in-advance models, and the Ramsey approach to optimal monetary taxation. A new chapter treats policy analysis in new Keynesisan models; the discussion includes the derivation of the policy objective function, optimal commitment and discretionary outcome, targeting rules,and instrument rules.</p><p>Carl E.

The unpredictability of deep-draft sea ice, shallow water, and possible Soviet discovery, all played a dramatic part in this fascinating 1970 voyage.<br><br> Covering 3,100 miles over a period of some 20 days at a laborious average speed of 6.5 knots or less, the attack submarine carefully threaded its way through innumerable underwater canyons of ice and over irregular seafloors, at one point becoming entrapped in an &#x201c;ice garage.&#x201d; Only cool thinking and skillful maneuvering of the nearly 5,000-ton vessel enabled a successful exit.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Alfred S.

And indeed, some of more valuable achievements of the intelligence community during the Cold War fell far outside the parameters of what the laymen might call &#x2018;spying.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Such was surely the case in 1970, when the nuclear submarine USS <i>Queenfish (SSN-651)</i> slipped under the Arctic ice pack and found its way 3,100 miles through uncharted waters to explore the continental shelf off the Siberian coast, site of many Soviet testing grounds and sensitive nuclear sites.

We all encounter probability problems in our everyday lives. In this collection of twenty-one puzzles, Paul Nahin challenges us to think creatively about the laws of probability as they apply in playful, sometimes deceptive, ways to a fascinating array of speculative situations. Games of Russian roulette, problems involving the accumulation of insects on flypaper, and strategies for determining the odds of the underdog winning the World Series all reveal intriguing dimensions to the workings of probability. Over the years, Nahin, a veteran writer and teacher of the subject, has collected these and other favorite puzzles designed to instruct and entertain math enthusiasts of all backgrounds. If idiots A and B alternately take aim at each other with a six-shot revolver containing one bullet, what is the probability idiot A will win? What are the chances it will snow on your birthday in any given year? How can researchers use coin flipping and the laws of probability to obtain honest answers to embarrassing survey questions? The solutions are presented here in detail, and many contain a profound element of surprise. And some puzzles are beautiful illustrations of basic mathematical concepts: &#34;The Blind Spider and the Fly,&#34; for example, is a clever variation of a &#34;random walk&#34; problem, and &#34;Duelling Idiots&#34; and &#34;The Underdog and the World Series&#34; are straightforward introductions to binomial distributions. Written in an informal way and containing a plethora of interesting historical material, Duelling Idiots is ideal for those who are fascinated by mathematics and the role it plays in everyday life and in our imaginations.</p><p><p>"For those of us who thoroughly enjoy a good puzzle, <i>Duelling Idiots</i> is indeed a welcome book.

The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history. This lovely boxed gift collection comprises <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, <i>Anne of the Island</i>, <i>Anne of Avonlea</i>, <i>Anne of Windy Poplars</i>, <i>Anne's House of Dreams</i>, <i>Anne of Ingleside</i>, <i>Rainbow Valley</i>, and <i>Rilla of Ingleside</i>.

The Roman leader Mark Antony, a virtual prisoner of his passion for her, is a man torn between pleasure and virtue, between sensual indolence and duty . . . between an empire and love. Bold, rich, and splendid in its setting and emotions, <b><i>Antony And Cleopatra</i></b> ranks among Shakespeare's supreme achievements.</p><p>William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in April 1564, and his birth is traditionally celebrated on April 23. The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019;s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including <i>Sir Thomas More</i> and <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as <b>The Tempest</b> and <b>Henry VII</b> until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.<i>Introduction<br></i><br><br>Shakespeare probably wrote <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> in 1606 or 1607; it was registered for publication on May 20, 1608, and apparently influenced a revision of Samuel Daniel&#x2019;s <i>Cleopatra</i> that was published &#x201c;newly altered&#x201d; in 1607. Antony and Cleopatra was thus roughly contemporary with <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Macbeth</i>. Yet the contrast between those two tragedies and Antony and Cleopatra is immense. Unlike <i>Macbeth</i>, with its taut focus on a murderer and his wife, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> moves back and forth across the Mediterranean in its epic survey of characters and events, bringing together the fates of Pompey, Octavius Caesar, Octavia, and Lepidus with those of the protagonists. <i>King Lear</i> gives proper names to fourteen characters, Macbeth to eighteen, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> to thirty-four. The Roman play requires no fewer than forty-two separate scenes, of which most occur in what modern editors label Acts 3 and 4, although no play is less suited to the classical rigors of five-act structure, and these divisions are not found in the reliable Folio text of 1623. Indeed, it is as though Shakespeare resolved at the height of his career to show that he could dispense entirely with the classical &#x201c;rules,&#x201d; which had never taken serious hold of the English popular stage in any case. The flouting of the unities is so extreme that John Dryden, in his <i>All for Love, or The World Well Lost </i>(1678), undertook not so much to revise Shakespeare as to start afresh on the same subject. Dryden&#x2019;s play is restricted to the last few hours of the protagonists&#x2019; lives, at Cleopatra&#x2019;s tomb in Alexandria, with a severely limited cast of characters and much of the narrative revealed through recollection. Although a substantial achievement in its own right, <i>All for Love</i> surely demonstrates that Shakespeare knew what he was doing, for Dryden has excised a good deal of the panorama, the excitement, and the &#x201c;infinite variety&#x201d; (2.2.246).<br><br>Shakespeare departs also from the somber tone of his tragedies of evil. He creates, instead, a world that bears affinities to the ambiguous conflicts of the other Roman plays, to the varying humorous perspectives of the comedies, and to the imaginative reconstructions of the late romances. As protagonists, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> lack tragic stature, or so it first appears: she is a tawny gypsy temptress and he a &#x201c;strumpet&#x2019;s fool,&#x201d; a once-great general now bound in &#x201c;strong Egyptian fetters&#x201d; and lost in &#x201c;dotage&#x201d; (1.1.13; 1.2.122&#x2014;3). Several scenes, especially those set in Egypt, are comic and delightfully bawdy: Charmian learning her fortune from the soothsayer, Cleopatra practicing her charms in vain to keep Antony from leaving Egypt or raunchily daydreaming of being Antony&#x2019;s horse &#x201c;to bear the weight of Antony&#x201d; (1.5.22), Cleopatra flying into a magnificent rage at the news of Antony&#x2019;s marriage to Octavia and then consoling herself with catty reflections on Octavia&#x2019;s reported low voice and shortness of stature (&#x201c;I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue, and dwarfish,&#x201d; 3.3.17). In its comic texture, the play somewhat resembles <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, an earlier play about a younger pair of lovers, although there the bawdry is used chiefly to characterize the lovers&#x2019; companions and confidants, whereas in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> it is central to our vision of Cleopatra especially. In any case, the later play is a tragedy about lovers who, despite their quarrels and uncertainties and betrayals of self, are reconciled in a vision of the greatness of their love. In its depiction of two contrasting worlds, also, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> recalls the movement of several earlier comedies from the realistic world of political conniving to a dream-world of the romantic and the unexpected. We can endorse neither world fully in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, and, accordingly, the vision of life presented is often ambivalent and ironic as much as it is tragic. The contrast of values separating Egypt and Rome underscores the paradox of humanity&#x2019;s quest for seemingly irreconcilable goals. The ending is neither a triumph nor a defeat for the lovers but something of both. If Antony and Cleopatra seem in one way too small to be tragic protagonists, in another way they seem too large, creating imaginative visions of themselves and their union that escape the realm of tragedy altogether. Our attention is focused less on the way in which the protagonists come to understand some meaningful relationship between their character and the fate required of them by a tragic universe than on the almost comic way in which the absurdities of Roman worldly striving and Egyptian dissipation are transfigured in the world of the imagination.<br><br>The Roman point of view opens the play and never entirely loses its force. At first, it may seem superior to that of Egypt. Demetrius and Philo, who invite us to view the play&#x2019;s first encounter between Antony and Cleopatra (1.1) from the perspective of the professional Roman soldier, lament the decline of Antony into Circean enslavement. Their tragic concept is of the Fall of Princes, all the more soberly edifying because of the height from which Antony has toppled. &#x201c;You shall see in him / The triple pillar of the world transformed / Into a strumpet&#x2019;s fool&#x201d; (1.1.11&#x2014;13). Egypt is enchanting but clearly enervating&#x2013;a bizarre assemblage of soothsayers, eunuchs, and waiting- gentlewomen who wish to be &#x201c;married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all&#x201d; (1.2.28&#x2014;9). Their mirth is all bawdry, tinged with practices, such as transvestitism, that Roman custom views as licentious. The prevailing images are of procreation in various shapes, sleep (mandragora, Lethe), the oriental opulence of Cleopatra&#x2019;s barge (a golden poop, purple sails, silver oars, divers-colored fans), Epicurean feasting, and drinking. As Enobarbus says, &#x201c;Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be&#x2013;drunk to bed&#x201d; (1.2.47&#x2014;8).<br><br>Antony, for all his reckless defiance of Rome, agrees in his more reflective moments with what Demetrius and Philo have said. &#x201c;A Roman thought hath struck him,&#x201d; Cleopatra observantly remarks, and Antony has indeed determined that &#x201c;I must from this enchanting queen break off&#x201d; (1.2.88, 135). His later return to Cleopatra is at least in part a surrender, a betrayal of his marriage vows to Octavia and his political assurances to Caesar. In the ensuing battles, Antony submits himself dangerously to Cleopatra&#x2019;s governance, and this inversion of dominance in sexual roles, as conventionally understood by the Roman patriarchal world, is emblematic of a deeper disorder within Antony. As Enobarbus concludes bitterly, Antony &#x201c;would make his will / Lord of his reason&#x201d; and so has subverted his &#x201c;judgment&#x201d; (3.13.3&#x2014;4, 37) to passion.<br><br>From the beginning, Cleopatra has sought dominance over Antony in the war of the sexes. When Antony first came to her on the River Cydnus, we learn, he was so overcome in all his senses that he was &#x201c;barbered ten times o&#x2019;er&#x201d; (2.2.234). Cleopatra boasts that she &#x201c;angled&#x201d; for Antony on many occasions, catching him the way fishermen &#x201c;betray&#x201d; fish, and that, when she had &#x201c;drunk him to his bed,&#x201d; she &#x201c;put my tires and mantles on him, whilst / I wore his sword Philippan&#x201d; (2.5.10&#x2014;23). Caesar, affronted by such transvestite debauchery, charges that Antony &#x201c;is not more manlike / Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy / More womanly than he&#x201d; (1.4.5&#x2014;7). During the battle scenes, Antony&#x2019;s followers complain that &#x201c;Photinus, an eunuch&#x201d; (probably Mardian), and Cleopatra&#x2019;s maids manage the war: &#x201c;So our leader&#x2019;s led, / And we are women&#x2019;s men&#x201d; (3.7.14&#x2014;15, 70&#x2014;1). Antony confesses too late that they were right. He becomes a &#x201c;doting mallard,&#x201d; one whose heart is &#x201c;tied by th&#x2019; strings&#x201d; to Cleopatra&#x2019;s rudder when her ships retreat in the first naval engagement (3.10.20; 3.11.56). In the mythic images used to raise their relationship to heroic proportions, Antony is like Mars to Cleopatra&#x2019;s Venus (1.5.19), in both a positive and a negative sense. The image has positive connotations of the way in which, as Milton puts it, the &#x201c;two great sexes animate the world,&#x201d; the masterful soldier and his attractive consort complementing one another in a right relationship of martial prowess and beauty, bravery and love, reason and will; however, to the Renaissance, the myth of Mars and Venus could also be read in a destructive sense, as an adulterous relationship in which reason is subverted to appetite. In another mythic comparison, Antony is like Hercules, not in his prime, but with the shirt of Nessus on his back&#x2013;a poisoned shirt given to Hercules by his wife in a mistaken hope of thereby assuring his love for her (4.12.43). Antony&#x2019;s soldiers understandably believe that the god Hercules has deserted his reputed descendant and onetime champion (4.3.21&#x2014;2).<br><br>Despite Antony&#x2019;s shameful violation of manhood, honor, attention to duty, self-knowledge, and all that Rome stands for, however, the end of his story is anything but a one-sided endorsement for the Roman point of view. The actual Rome, disfigured by political conniving, falls far short of the ideal. Antony has a point when he protests that &#x201c;Kingdoms are clay&#x201d; (1.1.37). Alliances are unstable and are governed by mere political expediency. At first, Antony&#x2019;s wife Fulvia and his brother Lucius have fought one another until forced to unite against the greater threat of Octavius Caesar. Similarly, Antony and Caesar come together only because Pompey has become dangerously powerful at sea and has won the favor of the fickle mob, &#x201c;Our slippery people&#x201d; (1.2.192). This d�tente is not meant to last. As Enobarbus bluntly puts it, &#x201c;if you borrow one another&#x2019;s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again&#x201d; (2.2.109&#x2014;11). Enobarbus is rebuked for his unstatesmanlike tone, but no one denies the validity of what he says. In this cynical negotiation, Octavia is a pawn between husband and brother, shabbily treated by both. Caesar coldly bargains away the happiness of the one person of whom he protests that &#x201c;no brother / Did ever love so dearly&#x201d; (2.2.159&#x2014;60). Antony, although hating false promises and resolving to be loyal to Octavia, knows within himself that it won&#x2019;t work. To make matters worse for the fair-minded Antony, he has received great favors from Pompey that he must now uncharitably repudiate in the interests of politics. Pompey does not miss the opportunity to remind Antony of his ingratitude, but the prevailing mood is not so much of bitterness as of ironic futility. Old friendships must be sacrificed; no one seems wholly to blame, and no one can stop the game. Pompey is as much in the wrong as anyone and as powerless. Despite his idealistic hope of restoring republican government to Rome, he has had to ally himself with pirates who offer him sinister temptations. He could be &#x201c;lord of all the world&#x201d; (2.7.62) if he would only murder on occasion, but Pompey is destined to be trapped between lofty ends and ignoble means. Lepidus is still another dismaying victim of political callousness, used condescendingly by Caesar and permitted to drink himself into oblivion, until he is cashiered on a trumped-up charge and imprisoned for life.<br><br>Octavius Caesar embodies most of all the ironic limits of political ambition. He has avoided enslavement to passion at the very real cost of enslaving himself to his public career as general, triumvir, and future emperor. His ideal warrior is one who, driven by military necessity, would &#x201c;drink / The stale [urine] of horses and the gilded puddle / Which beasts would cough at&#x201d; (1.4.62&#x2014;4). As a general, he is Antony&#x2019;s opposite in every way. He attacks only when he has the advantage and places those who have deserted Antony in his own front lines so &#x201c;That Antony may seem to spend his fury / Upon himself&#x201d; (4.6.10&#x2014;11). He controls his supplies cannily, believing it a &#x201c;waste&#x201d; to feast his army (4.1.17). He, of course, declines Antony&#x2019;s offers of single combat. Antony meantime recklessly accepts Caesar&#x2019;s challenge to fight at sea, feasts debauchingly in one &#x201c;gaudy night&#x201d; after another (3.13.186), and generously refuses to blame or penalize those who leave him. His sending Enobarbus&#x2019;s belongings after him into Caesar&#x2019;s camp convinces that honest soldier he has made a fatal error, for, however imprudent Antony&#x2019;s chivalry may be, it is unquestionably noble and great-hearted. Caesar is a superb general and political genius, but he is also a military automaton, a logistical reckoner, a Machiavellian pragmatist. In his personal life, he is no less austere and puritanical. He deplores loosening his tongue with alcohol. About women, he is deeply cynical, believing that &#x201c;want will perjure / The ne&#x2019;er-touched vestal&#x201d; (3.12.30&#x2014;1). Between him and Cleopatra, there is a profound antipathy, based in part on his revulsion at her earlier affair with his namesake and adoptive father, Julius Caesar (3.6.6). Cleopatra may entertain briefly the notion of trying to seduce this new Caesar (3.13.46 ff.), for like Charmian she loves long life &#x201c;better than figs&#x201d; (1.2.34), but, if so, she soon discovers that she and Caesar are not compatible. All that he represents she must instead grandly repudiate, choosing death and the fantasy of an eternity with Antony as her way to &#x201c;call great Caesar ass / Unpolicied&#x201d; (5.2.307&#x2014;8).</p><h2>Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace</h2><p><p><b> A brief and engaging conversation on how to write with clarity and grace. </b></p> <ul><li> Offers ten lessons on the principles of writing powerful, clear, and effective prose. </li> <li> Empowers writers to use their writing as a method to explore their own thinking. </li></ul><p><i>The Basics of Style</i> is a direct, engaging, brief conversation on writing with style.

Part I covers the basic concepts in transport phenomena. Part II covers applications in greater detail. Part III deals with the transport properties. The three transport phenomena-heat, mass, and momentum transfer-are treated in depth through simultaneous (or parallel) developments. Transport properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusion coefficient are introduced in a simple manner early on and then applied throughout the rest of the book. Advanced discussion is provided separately. An entire chapter is devoted to the crucial material of non-Newtonian phenomena. This book covers heat transfer as it pertains to transport phenomena, and covers mass transfer as it relates to the analogy with heat and momentum. The book includes a complete treatment of fluid mechanics for Ch. E&#39;s. The treatment begins with Newton&#39;s law and including laminar flow, turbulent flow, fluid statics, boundary layers, flow past immersed bodies, and basic and advanced design in pipes, heat exchanges, and agitation vessels. This text is the only one to cover modern agitation design and scale-up thoroughly. The chapter on turbulence covers not only traditional approaches but also includes the most contemporary concepts of the transition and of coherent structures in turbulence. The book includes an extensive treatment of fluidization. Computer programs and numerical methods are integrated throughout the text, especially in the example problems.</p><p></p><h2>Lockheed-Martin F/A-22 Raptor: Stealth Fighter (Aerofax)</h2><p>Initially referred to as the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF), the F-22 was designed to meet a USAF requirement for 750 new fighters to replace the F-15 Eagle. Work began in the early 1980s, and competition selection resulted in orders for flying demonstration prototypes of the YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23. The first of two prototypes was flown on 29th September 1990, and extensive testing and evaluation took place during that decade. In 1993 an air-to-ground attack role using precision-guided munitions was added to the original air superiority role, and the designation has been changed to F/A-22 to reflect this. The F-22 is designed to supercruise at up to Mach 1.5 without use of the afterburner, and its unusual layout is designed for agility as well as to incorporate stealth characteristics. A planned two-seat trainer version, the F-22B was cancelled, but production deliveries are now taking place, with service introduction planned for 2005. Author Jay Miller has followed the program closely to produce an extensively researched and well-illustrated review of this topical new fighter in the well-established and acclaimed Aerofax style and depth.</p><p>Jay Miller was born and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana.

He lives in San Francisco.THE SISTERS<br>There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said to me: "I am not long for this world," and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word <i>paralysis</i>. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word <i>gnomon</i> in the Euclid and the word <i>simony</i> in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.<br><br>Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to supper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if returning to some former remark of his: "No, I wouldn't say he was exactly . . . but there was something queer . . . there was something uncanny about him. I'll tell you my opinion. . . ." He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his mind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he used to be rather interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him and his endless stories about the distillery.<br><br>"I have my own theory about it," he said. "I think it was one of those . . . peculiar cases. . . . But it's hard to say. . . ." He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory. My uncle saw me staring and said to me: "Well, so your old friend is gone, you'll be sorry to hear."<br><br>"Who?" said I.<br><br>"Father Flynn."<br><br>"Is he dead?"<br><br>"Mr. Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the house."<br><br>I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the news had not interested me. My uncle explained to old Cotter.<br><br>"The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap taught him a great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him."<br><br>"God have mercy on his soul," said my aunt piously.<br><br>Old Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little beady black eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from my plate. He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate.<br><br>"I wouldn't like children of mine," he said, "to have too much to say to a man like that."<br><br>"How do you mean, Mr. Cotter?" asked my aunt.<br><br>"What I mean is," said old Cotter, "it's bad for children. My idea is: let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and not be . . . Am I right, Jack?"<br><br>"That's my principle, too," said my uncle. "Let him learn to box his corner. That's what I'm always saying to that Rosicrucian there: take exercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a cold bath, winter and summer. And that's what stands to me now. Education is all very fine and large. . . . Mr. Cotter <br>might take a pick of that leg of mutton," he added to my aunt.<br><br>"No, no, not for me," said old Cotter.<br><br>My aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table. "But why do you think it's not good for children, Mr. Cotter?" she asked.<br><br>"It's bad for children," said old Cotter, "because their minds are so impressionable. When children see things like that, you know, it has an effect..."<br><br>I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my anger. Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!<br><br>It was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for alluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his unfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic. I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It murmured; and I understood that it desired to confess something. I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and there again I found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin.<br><br>The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little house in Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop, registered under the vague name of Drapery. The drapery consisted mainly of children's bootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the window, saying: Umbrellas Re-covered. No notice was visible now for the shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the door-knocker with ribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape. I also approached and read:<br>July 1st, 1895<br>The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine's Church,<br>Meath Street), aged sixty-five years.<br>R. I. P.<br>The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was disturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his great-coat. Perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this present would have roused him from his stupefied doze. It was always I who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of his coat. It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief, blackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a week, with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite inefficacious.<br><br>I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock. I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shop-windows as I went. I found it strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal. He had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as the simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the Church had written books as thick as the Post Office Directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all these intricate questions. Often when I thought of this I could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart; and, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately. When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip--a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.<br>As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter's words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. I remembered that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion. I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the customs were strange--in Persia, I thought. . . . But I could not remember the end of the dream.<br><br>In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning. It was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds. Nannie received us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all. The old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt's nodding, proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banister-rail. At the first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the dead-room. My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated to enter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand.<br><br>I went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale thin flames. He had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of the bed. I pretended to pray but I could not gather my thoughts because the old woman's mutterings distracted me. I noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side. The fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin.<br><br>But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he was not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the altar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice. His face was very truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room--the flowers.<br><br>We crossed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we found Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses. She set these on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at her sister's bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed them to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but I declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them. She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke: we all gazed at the empty fireplace.<br><br>My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said: "Ah, well, he's gone to a better world."<br><br>Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent.

This is, after all, the third edition of a book I began writing more than twelve years ago, and one which, with any luck, I'll be adding to well into my dotage. </p><p>I look back in wonder remembering how daunting a task it seemed to be as I began writing the first FOOD LOVER'S COMPANION, a tome that took three years to complete. But what an enlightening educational adventure it was. And how lucky am I to be able to combine my two major passions (other than my husband Ron)--words and food. Writing the second and now the third edition of FOOD LOVER'S COMPANION has been equally as satisfying as writing the first, with only one regret--each time I've had to stop writing! </p><p>The response from you, dear reader, has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic and warm, which tells me that you love this continually evolving culinary universe as much as I do. I think you'll find this third edition of FOOD LOVER'S COMPANION markedly changed. Not only have I appended or revised a majority of the existing terms, but I increased the listings to almost 6,000. Sprinkled throughout this book are thousands of informative tidbits ranging from facts on how to choose, store and use ingredients to the origins of various foods and dishes to historical lore on food and drink. There are also pronunciations for all but the most basic words. One of the changes I think you'll like best is the completely altered and expanded Appendix. Among the sections revised are Ingredient Equivalents, Pan Substitution Chart, Food Label Terms, Consumer Information Sources, and Seasoning Suggestions. New sections include Recommended Safe Cooking Temperatures, British and American Food and Cooking Terms, Pasta Glossary and Wine and Spirit Bottle Sizes. </p><p>In the end, this new FOOD LOVER'S COMPANION is bigger and better than ever, all for the love of food and drink. I trust you'll find it both enjoyable and informative. And, at the very least, I hope that you receive as much pleasure from reading this book as I did from writing it.</p></p><h2>Human Resource Development: Talent Development, Loose-Leaf Version</h2><p>HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT is a comprehensive text for undergraduate and graduate courses that prepare students to train and develop people.

She centers her study on Thomas Hart Benton and Jackson Pollock, Benton's foremost student in the early thirties, charting Pollock's early imitation of Benton's style before his radical move to abstraction. By situating painting within the evolving sociopolitical and cultural context of the Depression and the Cold War, Doss explains the reasons for this change and casts light on its significance for contemporary culture.<br> <br> "A welcome addition to the growing body of literature that deals with the art and culture of the depression and cold war eras.

How is this possible? From a contemporary psychoanalytic perspective, this book seeks to answer that question in terms of the psychological dynamic of idealisation.<br>At the heart of living religion is the idealisation of everyday objects. Such idealisations provide much of the transforming power of religious experience, which is one of the positive contributions of religion to the psychological life. However, idealisation can also lead to religious fanaticism which can be very destructive. Drawing on the work of various contemporary relational theorists within psychoanalysis, this book develops a psychoanalytically informed theory of the transforming and terror-producing effects of religious experience. It discusses the question of whether or not, if idealisation is the cause of many of the destructive acts done in the name of religion, there can be vital religion without idealisation.<br>This is the first book to address the nature of religion and its capacity to sponsor both terrorism and transformation in terms of contemporary relational psychoanalytic theory. It will be invaluable to students and practitioners of psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, psychology and religious studies, and to others interested in the role of religion in the lives of individuals and societies.</p><p><strong>James W Jones</strong> is Professor of Religion, Adjunct Professor of Clinical Psychology at Rutgers University, New Jersey and Lecturer in Religion and Psychiatry at Union Theological Seminary in New York. He has doctorates in both clinical psychology and philosophy of religion and has a long history of successful publishing in religious and psychoanalytic subjects."James Jones shows how many modern psychoanalytic thinkers, including Winnicott, Kohut, Loewald and Bollas have moved on from Freud's rationalistic rejection of religion, and have prepared the ground for a much richer and more nuanced understanding of the ways in which religion can work both for good and ill, both to transform and to terrify.

But that is only a small part of its complicated and complicit performance history. In this sophisticated and historically grounded analysis, anthropologist Jennifer Robertson draws from over a decade of fieldwork and archival research to explore how the Revue illuminates discourses of sexual politics, nationalism, imperialism, and popular culture in twentieth-century Japan.<br><br>The Revue was founded in 1913 as a novel counterpart to the all-male Kabuki theater. Tracing the contradictory meanings of Takarazuka productions over time, with special attention to the World War II period, Robertson illuminates the intricate web of relationships among managers, directors, actors, fans, and social critics, whose clashes and compromises textured the theater and the wider society in colorful and complex ways.<br><br> Using Takarazuka as a key to understanding the "logic" of everyday life in Japan and placing the Revue squarely in its own social, historical, and cultural context, she challenges both the stereotypes of "the Japanese" and the Eurocentric notions of gender performance and sexuality.</p><p>"Jennifer Robertson casts the Takarazuka Revue as a hybrid protagonist in her innovative and demystifying analysis of sexual, social, and national order and disorder in twentieth-century Japan."&#x2015;Carroll Smith-Rosenberg, author of <i>Disorderly Conduct: Visions of Gender in Victorian America</i><b>Jennifer Robertson</b> is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Michigan, and author of <i>Native and Newcomer: Making and Remaking a Japanese City</i> (California, 1991).</p><h2>Microeconomics: Principles and Policy</h2><p>Master the principles of economics, and gain an understanding of current economic situations with the solid introduction and policy-based examples and applications found in MICROECONOMICS: PRINCIPLES AND POLICY, 13E.

Yet we have all had the experience of suddenly realizing that the keys or glasses that we had been looking for in vain were right in front of us the whole time. The capacity of our sense organs far exceeds our mental capabilities, and as such, looking at something does not guarantee that we will notice it. Our minds constantly prioritize and organize the information we take in, bringing certain things to the foreground, while letting others - that which we deem irrelevant - recede into the background. What ultimately determines what we perceive, and what we do not?<br><br>In this fascinating book, noted sociologist Eviatar Zerubavel argues that we perceive things not just as human beings but as social beings. Drawing on fascinating examples from science, the art world, optical illusions, and all walks of life, he shows that what we notice or ignore varies across cultures and throughout history, and illustrates how our environment and our social lives - everything from our lifestyles to our professions to our nationalities - play a role in determining how we actually use our senses to access the world. A subtle yet powerful examination of one of the central features of our conscious life, this book offers a way to think about all that might otherwise remain hidden in plain sight.<br></p><p><br>Eviatar Zerubavel is Board of Governors and Distinguished Professor of Sociology at Rutgers University and author of <em>Ancestors and Relatives: Genealogy, Identity, and Community</em>, and <em>The Elephant in the Room: Silence and Denial in Everyday Life</em>.<br><br>"Eviatar Zerubavel is the reigning master of what might be called nuance in human life. His rich mind and finely tuned sensibility allows him to discern the sound of what most of us cannot hear, the look of what we cannot see, the meaning of what we somehow manage to forget or block out from our line of vision. This is social science of a rare and special order." -Kai Erikson, Yale University<p></p><br>"<em>Hidden in Plain Sight</em> will make you more aware of all the interesting details in the world that most people do not notice." -Temple Grandin, author of <em>The Autistic Brain</em><p></p><br>"Attention, as the author demonstrates with a panoply of vivid examples, is at the center of social life. This concise and elegant essay richly deserves ours." -Paul DiMaggio, Princeton University<p></p><br>"In this concise and elegant book, Eviatar Zerubavel shows through myriad examples how what draws our attention in the visual field is not merely a matter of perception, but is fundamentally shaped by the social environment in which we live. As Zerubavel recognizes, although we assume that seeing is believing, what we see is often based on what we believe that we will see." -Gary Alan Fine, Northwestern University<p></p><br>"Zerubavel's aim is to offer a perspective he claims is missing in the research on attention-social attention.

This groundbreaking book uncovers the activism of visionaries--both well-known figures and unsung citizens--from across the ideological spectrum who sought something different from, or more complicated than, "integration." Local activists often played leading roles in carrying out the agenda of the NAACP, but some also pursued goals that differed markedly from those of the venerable civil rights organization. Brown-Nagin documents debates over politics, housing, public accommodations, and schools. Exploring the complex interplay between the local and national, between lawyers and communities, between elites and grassroots, and between middle-class and working-class African Americans, <em>Courage to Dissent</em> transforms our understanding of the Civil Rights era.</p><p><br><strong>Tomiko Brown-Nagin</strong> is Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.

One of the most efficient ways to study a war is with an atlas; however, most of the atlases devoted to this period focus almost exclusively on military movements and are prohibitively expensive for use in undergraduate courses. Offering a striking and reasonably priced alternative to these books, the <em>Concise Historical Atlas of the U.S. Civil War</em> is the only atlas that includes data maps and covers key issues before and after the war years. It balances military and non-military coverage, presenting maps that deal with political and social changes as well as campaign and battle maps.<br> Laid out chronologically and representing the complexity of the war both visually and textually, <em>Concise Historical Atlas of the U.S. Civil War</em> is an ideal study aid. Through detailed presentation of physical geography, it highlights the role of the landscape in troop movements and in social and demographic developments. Students can follow all the major campaigns of both the eastern and western theaters, examine the tactical movements in the major battles, and explore the geographic patterns behind issues like emancipation, occupation, and internal conflicts. The atlas features maps dealing with such subjects as economic capacity (both agricultural and industrial), enlistment rates, and the movement of escaped slaves. The maps also integrate information on the divisions that existed within the North and the South themselves. Accessible to students with limited geographic knowledge, the maps are clearly labeled, with key features marked. Each map is accompanied by a short narrative that provides helpful contextual information.<br> Featuring uniquely comprehensive coverage, the <em>Concise Historical Atlas of the U.S. Civil War</em> includes several maps situating the conflict in its antebellum origins as well as maps--of politics, sharecropping, and race relations--that extend the story through the end of Reconstruction. Ideal for use in U.S. Civil War History, Civil War and Reconstruction, and Southern History courses, this volume offers both novice and more experienced students new perspectives on the most significant events and circumstances of the era.<br></p><p>Aaron Sheehan-Dean is a Professor of History at the University of North Florida.<br>"This unique atlas includes the usual maps of military campaigns and battles--but much more besides. The maps illustrating political and social developments during Reconstruction as well as the Civil War are a valuable feature not found in other atlases. The essays accompanying each map offer a concise history of the era as an added bonus."--James M. McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em><p></p><br>"This atlas meets a longstanding need in the field of Civil War-era studies by presenting a wealth of military, political, social, and economic information in an easy-to-use format. Its combination of clear maps and Aaron Sheehan-Dean's perceptive accompanying text should appeal to a wide audience of both beginning and veteran students."--Gary W. Gallagher, author of <em>Causes Won, Lost, and Forgotten</em><p></p><br>"I was initially skeptical of the need for another Civil War atlas. This one provides easy-to-understand maps and text for the general student. It simplifies some complex information without being simplistic."--Mackubin Thomas Owens, Professor of National Security Studies, <em>U.S. Naval War College</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Mosby&#39;s 2019 Nursing Drug Reference (Skidmore Nursing Drug Reference)</h2><p><p>Put the most trusted name in nursing in your hands. <b>Mosby&#x2019;s 2019 Nursing Drug Reference</b> is a full-color portable nursing drug handbook that makes it easy to find the most vital information on the drugs that nurses administer most frequently.

The second section focuses on Chomsky&#39;s view of the mind and its parts - and how to study them. Finally, the third section examines some of Chomsky&#39;s many contributions to socio-political history and critique. This new edition examines Chomsky&#39;s views on a wide range of issues, from his views of the lexicon, language&#39;s evolution, and the study of mind to the status of capitalism and the Palestine-Israel conflict.

The comic industry&#x2019;s top awards, the Eisner Awards, are named in his honor.Structured around the induction of a young man much like himself into the army in 1942, Eisner's ( A Life Force ) autobiographical graphic novel examines the lives of Jewish immigrants and their children in pre-WW II Europe and America. As young Willie's troop train heads south, his window is transformed into a view of his family's past, full of the suffering and blunt anti-Semitism that characterized the times. Willie relives the death of his mother's father, who had immigrated to America in 1880, and the dispersal of her family among relatives and strangers. Willie's father--an aspiring artist in old Vienna--comes to the U.S. after the outbreak of the first world war to become a small-time businessman. Eisner's story is appealing but marred by schmaltzy confrontations and melodramatic graphics. He excels at recreating the family's daily struggle to survive, yet his characters and situations incline toward stereotype and his depictions of emotions--tearful eyes raised to heaven in joy or archly furrowed brows at the delivery of bad news--border on cliche. A vivid but flawed work from an acknowledged master of the comics medium. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Religion, Art, and Visual Culture: A Cross-Cultural Reader</h2><p>Religion, Art, and Visual Culture gathers together the most current scholarship on art, religion, visual culture, and cultural studies.

He and other Indians of the time, who occasionally saw samples of writing, called these mysterious pages the white man's "talking leaf." He experimented aimlessly at first, but gradually his conception took practical shape. It was slow and laborious work for an untutored Cherokee.&nbsp;Finally, after twelve years of labor and discouragement, he completed his syllabary, composed of eighty-five symbols, each representing a sound in the Cherokee language. The simplicity of the syllabary and its easy adaptability to the speech and thought of his people enabled them to master it in a few days. The Cherokee nation was made practically literate within a few months.</p><p><p><strong>Grant Foreman</strong> (1869-1953), known as the dean of American Indian historians, was the author of <em>Indian Removal, The Five Civilized Tribes</em>, and <em>Sequoyah</em> and editor of Ethan Allen Hitchcock?s <em>Traveler in Indian Territo</em>ry, all published by the University of Oklahoma Press.</p>&#x201c;A well-known historian has here told Sequoyah&#x2019;s story as it deserves to be told: simply, directly, and impressively.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i><br><br>"An excellent compact biography"-<i>Saturday Review</i><br></p><h2>Modern Epidemiology</h2><p>The thoroughly revised and updated Third Edition of the acclaimed Modern Epidemiology reflects both the conceptual development of this evolving science and the increasingly focal role that epidemiology plays in dealing with public health and medical problems.

It is to philosophy what the Classic Comic is to literature and the campaign ad to politics: Cliff Notes meet the sound bite. Short on text and long on large cartoons?emotivism gets 13 lines and four dialog balloons; the Theory of Forms seven lines and two balloons?the texts badly introduce individual thinkers or areas of thought. The sound bite is empty enough when presenting facts, but as a way to get across concepts, positions and arguments, it is self-defeating. These works necessarily emphasize what the thinker thinks, presented informationally, not why or how those conclusions were reached. Thus, even when the texts aren't superficial, the thinkers' claims are utterly obscure. The art work is high quality and witty, and the agenda clearly postmodern?Kant is read as a protodeconstructionist, the universalist enterprise of ethics gets mocked. Thus, their best audience is the opposite of the one intended: not the beginner but the advanced reader of philosophy who can appreciate the fun. At their best, these works belong in Father Guido Sarducci's "Five-Minute College," in which for each course he gives a slogan. At their worst, these books will change remembering a slogan to remembering a picture.

He stresses democracy's associational and communal aspects, maintaining that conscious, directed education is necessary to establish these conditions and to cultivate democratic character in students. Growth, experience, and activity are the factors Dewey employs to characterize the connection between learning and the variety of social, communicative activity that fosters a thriving democratic community.<br>As a conclusion, the author addresses the social barriers that inhibit democratic education. These divisions, he finds, derive from the practice of dichotomizing relationships between the mind and body, the mind and nature, and the individual and society. Dewey promotes a philosophy of education that negates these dualisms and focuses on freedom of the mind through directed social activity.</p><p></p></p><p>John Dewey(1859 1952) was anAmerican philosopher, psychologistandeducational reformerwhose ideas have been influential in education and social reform. Dewey was an important early developer of the philosophy ofpragmatismand one of the founders offunctional psychology. He was a major representative ofprogressive educationandliberalism.In 1894 Dewey joined the newly foundedUniversity of Chicago(1894 1904) where he developed his belief in an empirically based theory of knowledge, becoming associated with the newly emerging Pragmatic philosophy. His time at the University of Chicago resulted in four essays collectively entitledThought and its Subject-Matter, which was published with collected works from his colleagues at Chicago under the collective titleStudies in Logical Theory(1903). During that time Dewey also initiated theUniversity of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where he was able to actualize the pedagogical beliefs that provided material for his first major work on education, The School and Social Progress(1899).In 1899, Dewey was elected president of theAmerican Psychological Association. From 1904 until his retirement in 1930 he was professor of philosophy at both Columbia Universityand Columbia University&#39;sTeachers College.In 1905 he became president of theAmerican Philosophical Association.

It is written in a style that is crafted to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively for this targeted audience. Most students will bring little or no preexisting intellectual framework for comprehending this material. Therefore, whenever possible, I do not discuss a work of art without providing an accompanying illustration. I try to write clearly and succinctly in a manner that is similar to the way I teach, based on more than 25 years of teaching experience in such introductory-level courses. The topics discussed in each chapter have been selected to provide a foundation for these student readers. I hope that instructors of these courses will appreciate the text as a strategy for engaging their students and encouraging them to explore the fully published field, which is so rich and varied in methodologies. </p><p> This fourth edition of Women Artists in History provides this author with a welcome opportunity to build on the structure of the third edition and to incorporate a selection of the valuable scholarship published in the years since the last edition was written. In the third edition, detailed analyses of individual works of art, which had been objects of scholarly attention, provided the core structure of the text. This edition retains such focused discussions but incorporates some of the most compelling newly published scholarship. In this edition, readers will find each creator represented by one single illustration. This seemed to me to be the most effective way to balance the existing scholarship addressed in the third edition with the more recently published material. </p><p> The topics addressed in each chapter reflect the course of the current state of published research for each historical epoch. The issues vary because the material evidence of different times and places is so diverse. Therefore "feminist interventions into the histories of art," Griselda Pollock's well-known term for this scholarly practice, leads to an exploration of different types of issues for the five millennia of artistic production spanned by the scope of the text.' Feminists have suffered from the tyranny of meta-theories. We should not then seek to impose new methodological priorities for texts, course syllabi, or the research interests of our colleagues. I argue here for a flexible approach to the field of visual culture and art history. In this book I have tried to make selections from the broadest range of the outstanding scholarship in the field, which necessarily reflects a variety of methodological approaches. </p><p> It is unarguable that the contributions of women to the visual cultures of their societies go far beyond the small handful of women who became "professional artists." Women have participated in the visual arts on many levels, including the activities of amateur creators and as patrons, critics, and viewers. Whenever possible, I have indicated the roles of such women, especially as patrons, in the appropriate chapters. Such discussions naturally parallel the available published scholarship. </p><p> Interpretations of representations of women are also an important area of investigation for scholars studying the construction of gender distinctions in specific historical epochs. Art historians must address issues of "imagery" in their areas of expertise to deconstruct the "natural" categories of "Man" and "Woman" and their implicit power hierarchies. Such intellectual efforts provide us with one of the only escape routes for future generations to reinvent new, more tolerant, and more flexible definitions of gender. This scholarship is extremely valuable and important work. In this text, discussions of the roles of images of women are included in nearly every chapter prior to the eighteenth century. </p><p> However, Women Artists in History, does prioritize the works of women creators. The concrete material existence of these works of art by women artists with names attached, whenever possible, is the most direct didactic method to ensure that the contributions of women to visual culture will not be marginalized, minimized, or summarily dismissed. It is unthinkable to permit the art made by women to retreat into the invisibility and anonymity that existed prior to the 1970s. Therefore I believe that there is a responsibility to educate each new generation of college students with the outstanding creations of women artists. Given the limited number of illustrations that can be included in this text, I have chosen to include as many works created by women as is possible and practical. To shift the focus of the text to discussion of images of women, or works of art commissioned by women patrons but created by male artists, would inevitably result in many fewer works by women creators appearing as illustrations in this book. </p><p> It is undeniable that the text has a Eurocentric emphasis. This resulted necessarily from two factors, the current state of the literature and the practical limitations of space. There is simply much more scholarship currently in print on the women artists of Europe and the United States than for the creators from other continents. Furthermore, there are the physical limitations on the length of this book. Adding brief and, necessarily cursory, chapters describing women artists from other continents would have forced me to substitute some of the text devoted to the much more detailed and theoretically complex material which I have included. In the conclusion, a summary of the state of research on issues for global women creators has been added. This does not reverse the balance, but it does begin to point students in the directions of scholarship available on women artists of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand. As an introduction to this material, an essential part of the text is the updated bibliographies for each chapter. An annotated bibliography of general reference sources is also included. Students should be directed to these additional research materials, in English, which are published as books or essays, in refereed or peer reviewed publications. </p><p> Women Artists in History is like a "freeway" or "turnpike" for feminist art historical discourse. Each chapter is a' major "exit" into much more detailed scholarly work. Each subheading within the chapters is a road leading to more specialized studies. It is my intent that students use this book as a beginning point, a road map, to help guide them through what has become a terrain of complex and extremely sophisticated intellectual inquiry. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p><p> First, I acknowledge my debt to the sustained efforts of the scholars whose work is summarized in these pages. We are now benefiting from several generations of their expertise, that permits this text to become a very different book from the first edition, written in the early 1980s. </p><p> No textbook is created without a committed team. At Prentice-Hall I have been fortunate to work with a group of professionals without whose efforts this fourth edition could not have been produced. I would like to thank my revision editor Susan Alkana, whose support and insights moved this edition along at a crucial stage. I also wish to acknowledge Judy Winthrop's Herculean efforts to keep this project on track and on schedule and who knew when to say yes and no. As always, I am grateful to Bud Therien who has sustained this text through four successive revisions, and to the efforts of his assistant, Marion Gottlieb and Wendy Yurash, who were both patient and efficient. </p><p> I am most appreciative of the input from the readers who provided valuable suggestions in the earliest stages of this revision. </p><p> The students in my classes have constantly been an inspiration to me. Realizing that many were born after 1980 is a sobering lesson to all and reminds us of the need for "reiteration" and remembering that each individual class of students needs to be educated with a fresh perspective. </p><p> I gratefully acknowledge all those institutions, libraries, museums, and individuals who granted permission to reproduce the photos included in the text. </p><p> I wish to thank my family, Randy, Josh and Sara, who have lived with this revision with patience, tolerance, and good humor. Finally, I would like to recognize the support of my mother and especially, my father, who did not live to see this text printed.</p></p><h2>The Power of Prophetic Vision: How to Turn Your Dreams into Destiny</h2><p><b>Translate dreams into destiny!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> All of us have been called to something bigger than ourselves&#x2014;a dream or a vision that only God can help us fulfill.

In Cuba, posters were, and continue to be, popular tools to disseminate ideas, to encourage the Cuban people in the construction of a new society and to spread information on government programs and/or propaganda. The ideal democratic art form, poster art as it has flourished in Cuba also developed a unique idiom in film, music and sports. Today, many of these works, by celebrated poster artists such as Olivio Martinez Viera, Alfredo Rostgaard, F�lix Beltr�n, Rafael Morante, Eduardo Marin, Olivio Martinez, Antonio Fern�ndez Reboiro, Rafael Morante Boyerizo, Ren� Cardenas Azcuy, Victor Manuel Navarrete and Eduardo Mu�oz Bachs, are counted among the greatest posters produced in the twentieth century. In this overview of the subject, the influence of American Pop art and psychedelia, as well as earlier precedents in Dadaism, the Russian avant-garde and German Expressionism, can be seen to have informed Cuba&#x2019;s graphic arts. <i>Mira Cuba </i>collects more than 250 posters, sketches and layouts created between 1959 and the present.</p><p></p><h2>Student Study Guide to accompany Physics, 5e</h2><p>Student Study Guide to Accompany Physics, 5th edition:<br><br>Written for the full year or three term Calculus-based University Physics course for science and engineering majors, the publication of the first edition of Physics in 1960 launched the modern era of Physics textbooks.

From the past to the future, Bernstein&#39;s portrayal of gold is intimately linked to the character of humankind.</p><p>In the first chapter of his book <i>The Power of Gold</i>, Peter Bernstein quotes the immortal words of King Ferdinand of Spain, who once declared: "Get gold, humanely if possible, but at all hazards--get gold." As ensuing chapters reveal, man's obsession with finding, keeping, selling, and evaluating gold has rarely been a humane adventure and has always been a hazardous one. Digging deeply into history's treasury of torrid tales and complicated deals, Bernstein examines gold's lure with an economist's passion for quantification, a historian's eye for detail, and a sociologist's feel for its consequence.<p> Useless as a metal for most practical purposes, gold originally held value as decoration and adornment for the wealthy ancients. Later, it was minted and used as coins by the Lydians in 635 B.C. That, Bernstein goes on to reveal, put gold on a path from the concrete to the abstract, from evidence of wealth to the standard behind wealth in other forms, and finally to the tenuous place it holds in today's virtual world of credit cards and computer chips. Along the way lie wild stories of lives destroyed, fortunes won and quickly lost, and values transformed: the massacre by the Spanish invader Pizarro, whose small band of men decimated the formidable army of Emperor Atahualpa, "the Inca," through more duplicity than military skill; the roller-coaster ride of the 1890s, when the rippling impact of the Baring Brothers bank crisis in Britain sent the isolated United States into an economic meltdown; and the surplus of the Gold Coast natives of Timbuktu, who willingly traded their gold for much-needed salt, ounce for ounce.</p><p> Bernstein is a great storyteller. His accounts of mythological, ancient, and recent history ooze with odd and entertaining details that bring each successive tale of obsession to life. If not for his skill, the sheer volume of events collected here--presented more anecdotally than systematically--would be overwhelming. In the end, though, it is Bernstein's fascination with the power of gold to entangle and entrap its possessors, and its ultimate ability to change the course of entire eras and civilizations, that makes his book as fascinating as it is informative. A dense but entertaining read. --<i>S. Ketchum</i></p>"Bernstein...gives us a multifaceted depiction of the powerful pull gold has...his grasp on things financial...is firm, and he's admirably adept at explaining them." (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)</p><h2>Being Nixon: A Man Divided</h2><p><b>The landmark <i>New York Times</i> bestselling biography of Richard M. Nixon, a political savant whose gaping character flaws would drive him from the presidency and forever taint his legacy.&nbsp;</b><br><br> <b>&#x201c;A biography of eloquence and breadth . . . No single volume about Nixon&#x2019;s long and interesting life could be so comprehensive.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br> <b>One of <i>Time</i>&#x2019;s Top 10 Nonfiction Books of the Year</b><br><br> In this revelatory biography, Evan Thomas delivers a radical, unique portrait of America&#x2019;s thirty-seventh president, Richard Nixon, a contradictory figure who was both determinedly optimistic and tragically flawed. One of the principal architects of the modern Republican Party and its &#x201c;silent majority&#x201d; of disaffected whites and conservative ex-Dixiecrats, Nixon was also deemed a liberal in some quarters for his efforts to desegregate Southern schools, create the Environmental Protection Agency, and end the draft.<br><br> The son of devout Quakers, Richard Nixon (not unlike his rival John F. Kennedy) grew up in the shadow of an older, favored brother and thrived on conflict and opposition. Through high school and college, in the navy and in politics, Nixon was constantly leading crusades and fighting off enemies real and imagined. He possessed the plainspoken eloquence to reduce American television audiences to tears with his career-saving &#x201c;Checkers&#x201d; speech; meanwhile, Nixon&#x2019;s darker half hatched schemes designed to take down his political foes, earning him the notorious nickname &#x201c;Tricky Dick.&#x201d; Drawing on a wide range of historical accounts, Thomas&#x2019;s biography reveals the contradictions of a leader whose vision and foresight led him to achieve d�tente with the Soviet Union and reestablish relations with communist China, but whose underhanded political tactics tainted his reputation long before the Watergate scandal.<br><br> A deeply insightful character study as well as a brilliant political biography, <i>Being Nixon</i> offers a surprising look at a man capable of great bravery and extraordinary deviousness&#x2014;a balanced portrait of a president too often reduced to caricature.<br><br> <b>Praise for<i> Being Nixon</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Terrifically engaging . . . a fair, insightful and highly entertaining portrait.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Thomas has a fine eye for the telling quote and the funny vignette, and his style is eminently readable.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p><b>Evan Thomas</b> is the author of nine books: <i>The Wise Men</i> (with Walter Isaacson), <i>The Man to See, The Very Best Men, Robert Kennedy, John Paul Jones, Sea of Thunder, The War Lovers,</i> <i>Ike&#x2019;s Bluff, </i>and<i> Being Nixon</i>. <i>John Paul Jones </i>and<i> Sea of Thunder</i> were <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. Thomas was a writer, correspondent, and editor for thirty-three years at <i>Time </i>and<i> Newsweek, </i>including ten years (1986&#x2013;96) as Washington bureau chief at <i>Newsweek,</i> where, at the time of his retirement in 2010, he was editor at large.

The students wore togas and ate with their hands; the dry California hills passed for ancient Rome. Richard Nixon, the top student in the club, played Aeneas, Trojan hero and founder of Rome, and a girl named Ola Florence Welch played Dido, queen of Carthage.<br><br>Virgil&#x2019;s Aeneid imagines the ill-�fated romance of Aeneas and Dido. Dido is under the sway of Juno, who stands for domesticity and marital fidelity. Aeneas is ruled by Venus, goddess of passionate, sexual love. Dido beds Aeneas and regards herself as married. Aeneas, rather coldly, abandons Dido to fulfill his greater destiny. (&#x201c;To Italy I must go. There is the fatherland I must love.&#x201d;) Bereft, Dido throws herself on a funeral pyre, the gods&#x2019; reckoning for her hapless devotion.<br><br>It is doubtful that Nixon, age sixteen, was pondering the complexity of human nature and the vagaries of passion and commitment as he took the stage in the Whittier High gym. He had other worries. His feet hurt. It had taken both Latin teachers several minutes to tug the size-�9 silver boots over Nixon&#x2019;s size-�11 feet. &#x201c;The hour on stage in them was agony beyond belief and almost beyond endurance,&#x201d; Nixon recalled.<br><br>Worse, Nixon was supposed to take Dido in his arms, on stage, in public. He had never kissed a girl before, or even close&#x2014;�Whittier was an upright Quaker town and Nixon was bashful. When Aeneas in his toga and too-�small boots awkwardly reached out to embrace Dido, the student audience, heretofore bored, erupted in catcalls, hoots, and derisive laughter. Cheeks burning, the leading couple had to stop until the clamor died down.<br><br>Nixon later described the performance as &#x201c;an unbelievably horrendous experience.&#x201d; As the curtain fell to polite applause, the desperate-�to-�please high school junior volunteered to play the piano to entertain the disgruntled audience. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do anything to make the party a success,&#x201d; he told one of the Latin teachers. He was humiliated, however, and he lost his temper when one of the teachers criticized his clumsy performance.<br><br>Such a painful experience might have ended the thespian ambitions of any high school student (and Nixon did take away a lifelong aversion to wearing boots). But Nixon went on to act in several plays in college, with growing assurance and emotional range. Indeed, in 1952, when Nixon publicly wept after clearing his name from calumny with the so-�called Checkers Speech, his old acting coach, Albert Upton, exclaimed, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my boy! That&#x2019;s my actor!&#x201d;<br><br>Nixon&#x2019;s dramatic debut was a crisis, but for Richard Nixon, crisis was already normal&#x2014;�to be expected; endured; even, as time went on, welcomed. Defeat was what one overcame; rejection was to be reversed, if not avenged.<br><br>Two months before the Latin play, Nixon had been the choice of the Whittier High School faculty to become student body president. Nixon was responsible, dutiful, and attentive to his elders. But at the last moment, another boy, a popular athlete named Robert Logue, had entered as a surprise candidate and won the students&#x2019; votes. Nixon, who had been nicknamed &#x201c;Gloomy Gus&#x201d; by a few of the girls, had to settle for the position of &#x201c;administrator,&#x201d; appointed by the faculty. In photos in the Whittier High yearbook, the Cardinal and White, Logue looks like a tanned Adonis, with a confident smile, cleft chin, and swept-�back blond hair. In his photo, the dark-�haired Nixon looks young and anxious.<br><br>One of the girls who had voted for Bob Logue was Ola Florence Welch&#x2014;�Queen Dido. At the time of the election, she had written in her diary, &#x201c;Oh how I hate Richard Nixon.&#x201d; She had been mortified by her stage embrace with Nixon. &#x201c;We never practiced it. When we came to do it, it was very awkward and the kids went to pieces. I just about died,&#x201d; she recalled.<br><br>But when it was over, after briefly lashing out at his carping teacher, Nixon calmed down and grew purposeful. &#x201c;He never said a word about the play but he insisted that I must come over and meet his folks immediately,&#x201d; Ola Florence later recounted. Nixon wrote her a letter, apologizing for his &#x201c;caddish behavior&#x201d; (getting mad at the teacher) and explaining why, as he put it, he was &#x201c;so cracked up about you. . . . You are not a boy chaser. You use your brains to good purposes. You never show your anger to anyone. . . .&#x201d; He did not say anything about her looks, which, judging from photos, were striking, almost sultry.<br><br>Ola Florence reconsidered her opinion of Nixon. She decided that the dark-�haired, brooding boy was &#x201c;really quite handsome&#x201d; and that he was interesting, articulate, and unusual. They began going steady and remained a couple all through college. Indeed, while the romance was rocky, they would come close to marrying.<br><br>Aides to President Nixon like to reminisce and joke about Nixon&#x2019;s oft-�expressed dislike for Ivy Leaguers, particularly graduates of Harvard. In his memoir, H. R. Haldeman, Nixon&#x2019;s chief of staff, describes the president exclaiming, &#x201c;None of them in the Cabinet, do you understand? None of those Harvard bastards!&#x201d; Alexander Butterfield, a presidential assistant, recalled being summoned to the Oval Office after Nixon had somehow heard that the president of Harvard, Derek Bok, was on the White House premises. &#x201c;What is that son of a bitch doing here?&#x201d; Nixon demanded. Butterfield explained that Bok was a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, and that Harvard had donated some paintings. &#x201c;Never again!&#x201d; cried Nixon. &#x201c;How did he get in here in the first place?&#x201d; John Ehrlichman, another top Nixon aide, recalled that &#x201c;Nixon used to talk about the Eastern Establishment, but a lot of good people came from Harvard and similar places. He took them on, muttering and chirping all the time, about how deplorable it was, but he took them on and confided in them.&#x201d; Indeed, Theodore White noted that Nixon hired far more Harvard men than all the Harvard men who had been president (the two Adamses, the two Roosevelts, and Kennedy). Nixon chose as his foreign policy adviser a Harvard grad and Harvard professor, Henry Kissinger, and an equally intimidating Harvard professor, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, as his first domestic policy adviser. This was ironic but actually not surprising. Nixon was smarter, more intellectual, more open to ideas than almost any president who had come before him, including the ones who had gone to Harvard.<br><br>At graduation from Whittier High in June 1930, Nixon won the Harvard Club of California&#x2019;s award for outstanding all-�around student, &#x201c;which will probably irritate many of my friends who did go to Harvard,&#x201d; Nixon recalled a half-�century later. The award entitled Nixon to apply for a tuition scholarship from Harvard (he received a similar offer from Yale). But Nixon had to stay home. It was the Depression, and there was no money for travel or living expenses.<br><br>Nixon was not poor, exactly, but his family was cash-�strapped. Frank, his blustery, bullying father, was a rolling stone who had worked a number of low-�paying jobs, including as a trolley car conductor, factory hand, and oil roustabout. His mother Hannah, born to more genteel circumstances, endured lean times with a kind of tense grace. Frank would loudly denounce his bad luck and all who caused it; Hannah would smile sweetly, if a bit grimly, and keep her resentments bottled up.<br><br>Frank had planted some failing lemon groves in the thin soil of Yorba Linda in 1913, the year Nixon was born. The tiny town to the east of Los Angeles smelled sweetly of orange blossoms in the spring, but in the fall, when the Santa Ana&#x2014;�the fierce wind the Indians called &#x201c;Devil&#x2019;s Breath&#x201d;&#x2014;�blew in off the desert, young Nixon could hear rocks bouncing off the side of the little bungalow his father had built. The dust seeped in everywhere. On many nights, Hannah had to serve a dinner of fried mush.<br><br>Frank Nixon gave up the citrus groves and started up a gas station and grocery store on the road at the edge of Whittier, a nearby college town nestled amid eucalyptus and palm trees on a steep hillside. In the boom-�and-�bust of California&#x2019;s Southland of the 1920s, the gas station prospered. There had been enough money to send Richard&#x2019;s older brother, Harold, back east to Mount Hermon, a Christian boarding school in Massachusetts.<br><br>Harold Nixon was tall, blond, and handsome. The girls &#x201c;swooned over him,&#x201d; Richard recalled. Harold was fun-�loving and mischievous, outgoing and popular. He was a hellraiser and a cut-�up. Richard, as a little boy, was the opposite. He was solemn and fastidious and preferred his own company. His cousin Jessamyn West observed that &#x201c;he didn&#x2019;t seem to want to be hugged.&#x201d; He dressed in starched white shirts, and he carried his shoes in a bag when he went barefoot. He complained to his mother that other boys on the school bus smelled. &#x201c;He was very fussy, always neat,&#x201d; his mother Hannah recalled. &#x201c;He seemed to carry quite a little weight for a boy of his age.&#x201d;<br><br>If there is a lasting impression of Richard Nixon as a boy, it is one of solitariness. Friends and relatives remember him lying by himself in the grass, staring up at the sky, or wandering past the clusters of playing boys, lost in his own thoughts. He was a stickler for order. His uncle recalled that when the Nixon cousins were playing with a football, young Richard, age eight or so, took away the ball and sat by himself on the porch, insisting that he would give it back only when the others played by the rules. The sad-�faced boy with the unruly shock of black hair seemed to yearn for order and certainty.<br><br>Young Richard was a dreamer. He recalled listening to train whistles in the night, and when, on his thirteenth birthday, his grandmother Almira Milhous gave him a portrait of Lincoln, he hung it over his bed, along with a copy of Longfellow&#x2019;s Psalm of Life, written out in his grandmother&#x2019;s hand:<br><br>Lives of great men oft remind us<br><br>We can make our lives sublime<br><br>And departing leave behind us<br><br>Footprints in the sands of time.<br><br>It was a heavy burden for an impressionable boy. And yet Nixon had a slight subversive streak. As a boy as well as a man, Nixon could be painfully ill at ease, and his jokes sometimes fell flat. He would never be mistaken for a wit. But he did possess a mordant, dry hint of humor, even as a thirteen-�year-�old. In history class a few weeks after Grandmother Milhous set up Lincoln as a role model with Longfellow&#x2019;s poem, Nixon penned a parody&#x2014;�not a knee-�slapper, but a looser, more puckish try than might be expected from such a solemn, eager-�to-�please boy:<br><br>Now the lives of great men all remind us<br><br>We can make our lives that sort<br><br>And departing, leave behind us<br><br>Footprints on the tennis court.<br><br>Hardship, familiar to the Nixon household, became tragedy in 1925, the year Richard turned twelve. Arthur, the fourth son, died of a mysterious illness. In his memoirs, Nixon wrote that he cried every day for weeks. Nixon&#x2019;s mother, Hannah, recalled him just sitting and staring into space, silent and dry-�eyed. A couple of years later, Harold, too, became sick. Nixon knew something was wrong as soon as the family picked up the oldest boy up at the train station after his first year in Massachusetts. Harold was coughing and feverish. He had tuberculosis, a dangerous, frequently fatal disease.<br><br>Frank Nixon refused to take handouts, so he passed up the county hospital where &#x201c;lungers,&#x201d; as TB victims were sometimes called, could get free care, opting instead to pay for an expensive private sanatorium. When the money ran out, Hannah Nixon took her sick eldest son into the dry mountains of Prescott, Arizona, and set up a boarding house for Harold and a couple of other TB patients. Richard and his younger brother Donald were left at home in Whittier to fend with their father. It was a life of constant work, some of it drudgery. From the time he was fifteen or so, Richard arose every morning at four o&#x2019;clock to drive into the vegetable markets in Los Angeles to buy fresh produce for the family grocery store before heading off to school. In the summer, Nixon joined his mother in Arizona, where he did odd jobs (including as a carnival barker) while his mother changed bedpans and cleaned basins of bloody sputum.<br><br>Nixon referred to his mother as a &#x201c;saint.&#x201d; She spoke in a gentle voice but refrained from hugging or using expressions of endearment. True to her Quaker faith, she looked to an &#x201c;inner light&#x201d; and disliked showy religion. She said her evening prayers in a closet. Nixon feared his father&#x2019;s temper, but he was more frightened of his mother&#x2019;s &#x201c;look.&#x201d; Hannah had an &#x201c;iron hand inside her velvet glove,&#x201d; recalled Nixon&#x2019;s girlfriend, Ola Florence Welch. Hannah could punish just by her silence.<br><br>Nixon followed his mother&#x2019;s example of trying not to antagonize Frank Nixon. When his father grew belligerent, Richard would hide with a book. Near the Nixon bungalow was an irrigation ditch that was quite dangerous to small children. Hannah&#x2019;s sister, Elizabeth Milhous Harrison, recalled watching in horror as Frank grabbed his boys out of the irrigation ditch where they had been playing and then threw them back in again, yelling, &#x201c;If you want water, I&#x2019;ll give you enough.&#x201d; Their aunt cried out, &#x201c;Frank, you&#x2019;ll kill them, you&#x2019;ll kill them!&#x201d;<br><br>Hannah&#x2019;s family disapproved of Frank, who had never graduated from elementary school and was semi-�literate. Her sisters warned her not to stoop. The day Hannah and Frank were married, her little sister carved on a cherry tree, &#x201c;Hannah is a bad girl.&#x201d; The Milhous family was haughty, recalled Jessamyn West, and held itself above everyone but the other proper Quaker families who lived in Victorian houses on and around Whittier Hill. Nixon may have first felt the sting of snobbery within his own family.<br><br>Nixon was caught between his two parents, trying to please both. He sought love from one, then the other; one wonders if he ever really found it from either. &#x201c;Can you imagine,&#x201d; asked Henry Kissinger, &#x201c;what this man would have been like if somebody had loved him?&#x201d; Kissinger was exaggerating for effect, but Nixon&#x2019;s insecurities seem so profound that he must, as a child, have lacked for some essential assurance. Self-�protection, more than nurturing, seems to have been the order of the day in the Nixon household. Young Richard learned to avoid his father&#x2019;s temper and his hand. (As small boys, Richard and his brothers were not spanked but &#x201c;thumped,&#x201d; rapped on the head.) Richard watched as his mother intercepted customers in the store before Frank could bombard them with his vehemently held political views. If she didn&#x2019;t get there in time, she sometimes followed the browbeaten customers out the door, trying to soothe them. In his memoirs, Nixon was still abashed by the shouting matches between his father and his brothers that could be heard &#x201c;all across the neighborhood.&#x201d; In a rare instance of self-�reflection, Nixon wrote, &#x201c;Perhaps my own aversion to personal confrontations dates back to these early recollections.&#x201d;</p><h2>The New York City Draft Riots: Their Significance for American Society and Politics in the Age of the Civil War</h2><p>For five days in July 1863, at the height of the Civil War, New York City was under siege. Angry rioters burned draft offices, closed factories, destroyed railroad tracks and telegraph lines, and hunted policemen and soldiers. Before long, the rioters turned their murderous wrath against the black community. In the end, at least 105 people were killed, making the draft riots the most violent insurrection in American history.<br><br>In this vividly written book, Iver Bernstein tells the compelling story of the New York City draft riots. He details how what began as a demonstration against the first federal draft soon expanded into a sweeping assault against the local institutions and personnel of Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party as well as a grotesque race riot. Bernstein identifies participants, dynamics, causes and consequences, and demonstrates that the "winners" and "losers" of the July 1863 crisis were anything but clear, even after five regiments rushed north from Gettysburg restored order. In a tour de force of historical detection, Bernstein shows that to evaluate the significance of the riots we must enter the minds and experiences of a cast of characters--Irish and German immigrant workers, Wall Street businessmen who frantically debated whether to declare martial law, nervous politicians in Washington and at City Hall. Along the way, he offers new perspectives on a wide range of topics: Civil War society and politics, patterns of race, ethnic and class relations, the rise of organized labor, styles of leadership, philanthropy and reform, strains of individualism, and the rise of machine politics in Boss Tweed's Tammany regime.<br><br>An in-depth study of one of the most troubling and least understood crises in American history, <em>The New York City Draft Riots</em> is the first book to reveal the broader political and historical context--the complex of social, cultural and political relations--that made the bloody events of July 1863 possible.<br></p><p><br><strong>Iver Bernstein </strong>is Professor of History and African and African American Studies at Washington University in St. Louis.<br><br>"An original work in the historiography of Civil War America and labor history, and also synthesizes much of the current historical research. It stimulates and provokes. Most important, it recaptures much of the world we have lost."--<em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Especially appealing...When Bernstein crosses historical genres, it's an almost synesthetic pleasure...<em>The New York City Draft Riots</em> establishes a world as it was lived in. Its outline shows clearly against the backdrop of our own populist racism, in what is still the unreconstructed North."--<em>Village Voice</em><p></p><br>"An outstanding piece of social, economic, and political history, suggesting the benefits of integrating new and older historiography, the book also illustrates a pitfall or two that historians may wish to keep in mind...An excellent, revelatory book...His writing is clear and his immense research shines on every page."--<em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"Detailed and sophisticated...An impressive book. Bernstein displays ingenuity in conceiving of the riots as something more than an abrupt, momentary episode, and he has dug deep to locate sources...Clearly the new interpretive authority."--<em>Georgia Historical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Not since David Montgomery's <em>Beyond Equality</em> (1967) has the relationship between Civil War politics and the social history of the urban-industrial North been explored so successfully as in this study."--<em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Foundations Of Algorithms</h2><p>Foundations of Algorithms, Fourth Edition offers a well-balanced presentation of algorithm design, complexity analysis of algorithms, and computational complexity.

This agreement united two individuals for a lifetime and meant that the most intense forms of friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice had been exchanged. God chose to make this kind of covenant with Abraham in order to demonstrate His intense love for humanity and His deep desire to fellowship with His creation. By asking Abraham to perform the covenant ritual, God the Father and humanity were bonded for eternity.In The Covenant, well-known author Jim Garlow explains, with passion and possibility, the importance and meaning of the Covenant ritual and shows how this ceremony provides the foundation for everything we, as Christians, believe. The powerful revelations he presents will impact and transform your life and forever change your knowledge and appreciation of the Christian faith.This powerful Bible study will dramatically enrich your understanding of God&#x2019;s nature and love for His people and reveal a whole new appreciation for God&#x2019;s amazing story and the beautiful, incredible, breathtaking sacrifice that Christ made so God&#x2019;s covenant with us would not be broken.</p><p>James L.

The author&#39;s previous novels include &#34;The Joke&#34;, &#34;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&#34; and &#34;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&#34;.</p><p>Milan Kundera, born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, was a student when the Czech Communist regime was established in 1948, and later worked as a labourer, jazz musician and professor at the Institute for Advanced Cinematographic Studies in Prague. After the Russian invasion in August 1968, his books were proscribed. In 1975, he and his wife settled in France, and in 1981, he became a French citizen. He is the author of the novels The Joke, Life is Elsewhere, Farewell Waltz, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and Immortality, and of the short-story collection Laughable Loves - all originally in Czech. His most recent novels, Slowness, Identity and Ignorance, as well as his non-fiction works The Art of the Novel and Testaments Betrayed, were originally written in French.<p><b>Part One</b></p><p><b>The Depreciated Legacy of Cervantes</b></p><p>In 1935, three years before his death, Edmund Husserl gave his celebrated lectures in Vienna and Prague on the crisis of European humanity. For Husserl, the adjective "European" meant the spiritual identity that extends beyond geographical Europe (to America, for instance) and that was born with ancient Greek philosophy. In his view, this philosophy, for the first time in history, apprehended the world (the world as a whole) as a question to be answered. It interrogated the world not in order to satisfy this or that practical need but because "the passion to know had seized mankind."</p><p>The crisis Husserl spoke of seemed to him so profound that he wondered whether Europe was still able to survive it. The roots of the crisis lay for him at the beginning of the Modern Era, in Galileo and Descartes, in the one-sided nature of the European sciences, which reduced the world to a mere object of technical and mechanical investigation and put the concrete world of life, die Lebenswelt as he called it, beyond their horizon.</p><p>The rise of the sciences propelled man into the tunnels of the specialized disciplines. The more he advanced in knowledge, the less clearly could he see either the world as a whole or his own self, and he plunged further into what Husserl's pupil Heidegger called, in a beautiful and almost magical phrase, "the forgetting of being."</p><p>Once elevated by Descartes to "master and proprietor of, nature," man has now become a mere thing to the forces (of technology, of politics, of history) that bypass him, surpass him, possess him. To those forces, man's concrete being, his "world of life" (die Lebenswelt), has neither value nor interest: it is eclipsed, forgotten from the start.</p></p><h2>ECCE ROMANI 09 LEVEL 1B SE</h2><p><p>The softcover split edition of ECCE ROMANI 1 contains the first 17 <br>chapters.</p> <p>View the Ecce Romani Interactive Textbook</p></p><p></p><h2>Caspar David Friedrich: Moonwatchers</h2><p>Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840), a major figure in the German Romantic movement, painted sublime works representing nature at its most melancholic and desolate. One of his most famous motifs was that of two intimate figures, seen from behind, gazing at the moon. Friedrich painted three versions of this theme, one of which-Two Men Contemplating the Moon-has recently been acquired by The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The book discusses the Metropolitan&#39;s painting in conjunction with the other two versions and a number of related paintings and drawings by Friedrich and his Dresden friends. It also presents fascinating details about the moon itself-including what was known about it in Friedrich&#39;s lifetime and its presence and symbolism in contemporary Romantic poetry.</p><p>This beautifully produced volume accompanies an exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art from September to November 2001.Sabine Rewald is Associate Curator in the Department of Modern Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
